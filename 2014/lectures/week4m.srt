>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,460
>> SPEAKER 1: All right, this is CS50,
and this is the start of week four,

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,420
and as you may have heard or
read, the world has been ending.

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,520
Going all around the internet
has been knowledge and awareness

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,100
of a bug in a program, a
programming language called Bash.

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:32,729
This has been wonderfully branded
as Shellshock, or the Bash door,

7
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,485
but articles like these
have not been uncommon.

8
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:38,807
And in fact, many of them bring
back memories of Heartbleed,

9
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:41,640
which you may have noticed in the
press back this past spring, which

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,980
was similarly fairly dramatic.

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,110
Now of those of you here
today, how many of you have,

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,330
even if you don't understand what
it's all about, heard of Shellshock?

13
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,370

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,245
All right, and how many of you
have computers that are vulnerable?

15
00:00:54,245 --> 00:00:55,680

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,250
OK, there should be far, far more hands
up right now, for reasons we shall see.

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,580
>> Let's take a look at what's
been going on in the media

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,304
and then explain it a bit
here for us technically.

19
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:07,670

20
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,250
>> SPEAKER 2: Security experts have
warned that a serious flaw could

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,650
be about to affect hundreds of
millions of the world's web users.

22
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,600
So what exactly is the bug that's been
dubbed Shellshock, and what does it do?

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,720

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,910
Well, Shellshock is also known as the
Bash bug, the software it exploits.

25
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,230
Hackers use the virus to scan vulnerable
systems running Linux and Unix

26
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,300
operating systems and then infect them.

27
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,730
Bash is a command line shell.

28
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:43,460
This lets users issue commands to launch
programs and features within software

29
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,250
by typing in text.

30
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,980
It's typically used by programmers, and
shouldn't be open to the wider world,

31
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,590
though Shellshock changes that.

32
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,160

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,910
>> Well, worringly, some analysts
warn it could be a bigger threat,

34
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,580
because Shellshock allows complete
control of an infected machine,

35
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,030
whereas Heartbleed only allowed
hackers to spy on computers.

36
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,130
It's so serious, it's
been rated a 10 out of 10

37
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,900
for severity by the National
Vulnerability Database.

38
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,530

39
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,015
2/3 of all web servers are at
risk, including some Mac computers.

40
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,760

41
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,600
Well, make sure you
patch your systems now.

42
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,330
Anyone hosting a website running
the affected operating systems

43
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,800
should take action as soon as possible.

44
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,390
Anyone who can afford it should look
to their monitoring and web application

45
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,355
firewalls to look out for any attacks.

46
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:39,979

47
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:41,770
SPEAKER 3: Worst thing
that could happen is

48
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,080
that somebody would write code that
would automatically go and scan

49
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,280
the internet and would affect
all of these computers.

50
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,710
And once they do that, well,
the worst thing they could do

51
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,300
is just delete everything,
or shut the sites down.

52
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,360
So we could see damage
from that point of view,

53
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,300
where we would have malicious people
who just decide to cause havoc

54
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,534
by bringing systems down or deleting
files, and things like that.

55
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:05,200
SPEAKER 2: Some say this is one
of the most difficult to measure

56
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,080
bugs in years, and it
may take weeks or even

57
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,820
months to determine its ultimate impact.

58
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,180

59
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,560
>> SPEAKER 1: So all of that is true,
but the funny thing is, almost all

60
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,330
of the imagery you just saw,
except for maybe the keyboard,

61
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,930
has nothing to do with
the bug whatsoever.

62
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,960
Servers and wires and so forth,
it's sort of tangentially related,

63
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,410
but at the core it's actually pretty
familiar what's going on here.

64
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,050
In fact, let me go into
our CS50 appliance.

65
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,910
Let me go ahead and maximize
the terminal window here.

66
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,020
And you guys have been using this,
or the embedded version thereof,

67
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,460
in gedit in order to write programs,
type commands, and so forth,

68
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,690
and this is actually, and has
been for weeks, Bash, B-A-S-H.

69
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,890
This is the Bourne-again shell,
which is just a fancy way of saying,

70
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,220
this is a program that has a
blinking prompt, effectively,

71
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,970
that sits there waiting
for input for you.

72
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,920
And it's the command
line interface via which

73
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,650
you guys have been running commands and
ultimately compiling and then running

74
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,400
programs.

75
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,320
>> But Bash is also a programming
language in the following sense.

76
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,460
You know that there are commands like
cd and ls and also clang and others,

77
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,580
but you can define your own commands
by implementing them in Bash.

78
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,420
Now we're not going to
go into great detail

79
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,089
as to Bash the programming language, but
know, for instance, that at the moment,

80
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,607
there's no command called "hello."

81
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:19,440
So it can be found in
one of these packages.

82
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,856
It's not installed on my computer.

83
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:21,870
Ask your administrator.

84
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,030
But if I want there to be a program
called "hello" in Bash or at my prompt,

85
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,810
I can actually use syntax that's
quite like C. It's not quite the same,

86
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,020
but it looks pretty similar to a
function, albeit missing some details.

87
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,090
Nothing seems to happen,
but now if I type "hello,"

88
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,960
you can actually write a
program, not in C, not in Java,

89
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,280
not in another programming
language, but in Bash itself.

90
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,630
>> Now the key here is that I wrote the
name I wanted to give this new command,

91
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,820
and the parentheses are also
symbolic of this being a function.

92
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,010
As an aside, you can also do fun
things, and in fact, even on Mac OS,

93
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,620
this is a program called Terminal.

94
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,800
It comes built into anyone's
computer that has a Mac in this room,

95
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,640
and you can do similar things in Mac
OS, but you can go more beyond that.

96
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,110
And this is a little tangential,
but it's kind of fun.

97
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,715
I was reminded this morning,
when thinking this through,

98
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:13,279
of a little game I used to play
with one of CS50's former TFs

99
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,570
whereby any time he would walk away from
his keyboard with his screen unlocked,

100
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:23,611
I would execute a command
like this-- "say hello."

101
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:26,610
And now any time he came back to his
keyboard after I cleared the screen

102
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,985
and he would sit down,
try to do some work,

103
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:29,250
list the contents of his directory--

104
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:29,510
>> [AUDIO PLAYBACK]

105
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,010
>> -Hello.

106
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,621

107
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:32,120
Hello.

108
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,030
>> SPEAKER 1: So, in fairness,
it wasn't actually "hello."

109
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,894
It was usually something
more akin to that--

110
00:05:36,894 --> 00:05:37,560
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

111
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:37,750
-Beep.

112
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,320
SPEAKER 1: --that I would--
so his computer would

113
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,170
swear at him any time he actually
sat down at his keyboard.

114
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:46,265
And very quickly he figured out
not to leave his screen unlocked.

115
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:48,730
But this suggests the sort
of stupid fun that you

116
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,210
can have with something like Bash.

117
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,770
But it's a little more
serious, to be sure, than that.

118
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:57,235
And in fact, this is one of the
most dangerous and long-lasting bugs

119
00:05:57,235 --> 00:05:58,860
that has really hit the world globally.

120
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,060
This bug has been around
for some 20 years,

121
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,780
and you'll be struck in just a
moment by its relative simplicity.

122
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,990
>> So this is a representative
command that if you

123
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,448
own a Mac, literally right now
when you have your lid open,

124
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:12,940
you can try typing into that
program called Terminal.

125
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,410
Terminal is under
Applications Utilities--

126
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,790
for once, Windows users don't have to
worry about this particular threat--

127
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,310
but those of you with Macs can type
this into a window like I'll do here,

128
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,210
and if you do type
that into this program

129
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,830
called Terminal, like I'll do now,
if you see the word "vulnerable,"

130
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,200
your computer is
vulnerable to exploitation.

131
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,850
>> Now what does that actually mean?

132
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,870
And this is admittedly
some pretty crazy syntax,

133
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,050
but let's at least draw out
some of the interesting aspects.

134
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,567
So there's some syntax that looks
a little familiar, at least from C

135
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:43,950
and programming more generally.

136
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,550
I see some parentheses,
semicolons, curly braces, and such,

137
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,820
but it turns out that this
stupid thing here in yellow

138
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,580
is essentially a function
that does nothing.

139
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,840
The colon means do nothing, and the
semicolon means stop doing nothing.

140
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,250
So inside of these
curly braces, the fact

141
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,440
that I have an equal
sign to the left, this

142
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,500
is essentially creating
a command, or a variable,

143
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,520
called x, and assigning it
that yellow bit of code there.

144
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,040
That could be something like "echo
hello" or "say beep" or something

145
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,120
akin to that.

146
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,780
But notice if your eyes
wander further to the right,

147
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,150
there's more to this line than
just the end of that semicolon.

148
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,160
"Echo vulnerable," and then
beyond that there's even more.

149
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,530
Another semicolon, bash -c:.

150
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,120

151
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,050
>> So long story short,
this line of code is

152
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,660
sufficient for compelling
a computer that's

153
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,830
vulnerable to doing something
that you want it to do,

154
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,290
because there's a bug in Bash whereby
even though Bash was supposed to stop

155
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,980
reading lines of command right
there after the yellow text,

156
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,520
for a 20-plus year old bug,
Bash has actually been reading

157
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,780
beyond that semicolon and pretty
much doing what it is told.

158
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,070
>> So what's the implication
of that ultimately?

159
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,340
I just said "echo hello"
or "echo vulnerable,"

160
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,449
but what if you did something
actually malicious, like rm -rf *,

161
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:07,240
which you might not
have ever typed before,

162
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,920
and frankly you probably
shouldn't too soon,

163
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,700
because you can do a
lot of damage with it.

164
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,210
Why?

165
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,990
rm does what, of course?

166
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,270
Removes.

167
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,930
* means what?

168
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,430
All.

169
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,180
So it's a so-called
wild card, so it means

170
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,410
delete everything in
the current directory.

171
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,379
-r happens to mean recursive,
which means if what you're deleting

172
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:26,420
is a directory, and inside of there
is other files and other directories,

173
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,950
recursively dive into there
and delete all of that.

174
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,040
And -f is the worst of them all.

175
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,580
Anyone know what -f means here?

176
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,690

177
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,360
Force.

178
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,830
So force means, even
if this is a bad idea,

179
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,939
do it without prompting me
for further confirmation.

180
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:43,230
So, you know, we laugh at
this, but frankly, I probably

181
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,972
type this multiple times
a day, because the reality

182
00:08:44,972 --> 00:08:47,210
is it's the fastest way to
delete a whole bunch of stuff.

183
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,590
But even I have done some damage.

184
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,100
>> But if you were to trick a computer
into defining some stupid variable

185
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,810
or function called x, but then
tricking the computer into executing

186
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,030
beyond the boundaries of that
function, beyond that semicolon,

187
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,430
you could indeed trick a computer
into executing something like rm -rf

188
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,810
or the Email command
or the Copy command.

189
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,400
Anything literally you can do with the
computer, whether it's deleting files,

190
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,350
creating files, spamming someone,
attacking some server remotely,

191
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,190
if you can express it
with a command, you

192
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,120
can trick a computer into doing that.

193
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,510
>> Now what's an example of
how you might do this?

194
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,300
Well, there's a lot of computers
on the internet running Bash.

195
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,390
All of us Mac users are among them.

196
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,390
A lot of Linux servers are among
them as well, and Unix servers.

197
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,630
Windows again gets
relatively off the hook

198
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,590
unless you've installed
special software.

199
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,130
Now a lot of servers, for
instance, run web servers,

200
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,840
and in fact Linux is perhaps the
most popular operating system

201
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,060
to run on computers on the internet
that are serving up web pages.

202
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,910
Now as we'll see later
in the semester, when

203
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,470
you send a request from
your browser-- Chrome,

204
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,790
Internet Explorer, whatever--
to a remote server,

205
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,730
it turns out that even though
you just typed www.example.com,

206
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:59,590
your browser is sending a message
that's a little more arcane, like this.

207
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,239
>> But notice a little something strange.

208
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:03,030
The first two lines
I've never seen before,

209
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,904
but they don't look
particularly threatening.

210
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:08,030
But notice what I've stolen
for the third line here.

211
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:13,390
If a bad guy were to send a message
like this from his or her computer

212
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:17,270
to a vulnerable Mac or a
vulnerable Linux server,

213
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,580
the funny thing is that Bash,
that simple little command prompt,

214
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:27,450
is omnipresent and is often
used to essentially execute

215
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,020
the contents of a
message that it receives.

216
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,490
And by that logic, you can
trick a web server, therefore,

217
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,370
by sending something like
User-Agent, which usually

218
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,300
is supposed to say the
name of your browser.

219
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,420
User-Agent Chrome, User-Agent Internet
Explorer, User-Agent Firefox, this

220
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,590
is just your browser's
way of identifying itself.

221
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,605
But if a bad guy very
cleverly says, mm-mm, I'm

222
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:47,930
not going to tell you
what my browser is,

223
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,888
I'm instead going to send you this
cryptic-looking thing with an rm -rf

224
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:55,840
* in it, you can literally trick a
vulnerable web server on the internet

225
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,055
into executing exactly that in
there for deleting all of the files.

226
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:00,930
And frankly, that's not
even the worst of it.

227
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,763
You can do anything.

228
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:04,480
You could start a distributed
denial of service attack

229
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,030
if you sent this message to
whole bunches of web servers

230
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,256
and then had them all descend, for
instance, on Harvard.edu servers,

231
00:11:10,256 --> 00:11:12,130
and you can sort of bang
the heck out of them

232
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,490
by a network traffic that was
otherwise triggered by this bad guy.

233
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,760
>> So, long story short, almost
everyone in this room who owns a Mac

234
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,240
is vulnerable to this.

235
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,100
The silver lining is that unless you're
running a web server on your laptop,

236
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,780
and unless you've actually configured
it to allow something like SSH into it,

237
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,670
you're actually safe.

238
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,710
It's vulnerable, but there's no
one trying to get into your laptop,

239
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,290
so you can sort of rest assured.

240
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,210
However, Apple will soon
be updating a fix for this.

241
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,660
The world of Linux has already released
a number of fixes for Fedora and Ubuntu

242
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,790
and other versions of Linux, and indeed
if you run update 50 in the appliance,

243
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,930
even that too will be
updated and corrected.

244
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,764
But that too has not
really been vulnerable,

245
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:49,804
because unless you've
tinkered with the appliance

246
00:11:49,804 --> 00:11:52,770
and made your laptop publicly
accessible on the internet, which is not

247
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,910
by default, you've
actually been fine because

248
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,890
of firewalling and other techniques.

249
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,000
>> But it's an extreme example of a bug
that we've lived for for literally 20

250
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,050
years, and who knows if someone
all this time has known about it?

251
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,300
And in fact, this is one of
the fundamental challenges

252
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,690
that we'll see later in the
semester about security,

253
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,020
is that just like in the real world,
the good guys are at the disadvantage.

254
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,500
To keep the bad guys out, we have to
make sure that every door is locked,

255
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,340
that every window is secure, that
every point of entry into a home

256
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,980
is secure to keep the bad guys out.

257
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,870
But what does the bad guy have to
do to actually compromise your home

258
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,200
and steal from you?

259
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,574
He or she just has to find one unlocked
door, one broken window, or something

260
00:12:32,574 --> 00:12:35,240
along those lines, and it's the
same thing in computer security.

261
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,660
We can write millions of
lines of programming code

262
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,570
and spend hundreds or thousands
of hours trying to get it correct,

263
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,370
but if you make just one
mistake in correctness,

264
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,030
you can put the entire system and
indeed in this case, the entire internet

265
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,660
and world at risk.

266
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,950
>> So if you'd like to learn more
about this, go to this URL here.

267
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,450
There's no need for action
tonight unless you're

268
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,116
among those more comfortable that
have been running your own web

269
00:12:57,116 --> 00:12:59,810
server, in which case you should,
in fact, update your software.

270
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,244
>> And this too is the title of
a speech, and now a paper,

271
00:13:03,244 --> 00:13:05,410
that we've linked on the
course's website for today.

272
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,600
It was by a fellow
named Ken Thompson, who

273
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,120
was accepting a very famous
award in computer science,

274
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,495
and he gave this speech some years
ago, essentially on this same topic.

275
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:18,250

276
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,520
Asking folks the question,
should you really

277
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,480
trust, ultimately, the
software you've been given?

278
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,100
For instance, we all have
been writing programs,

279
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,820
and we've been compiling
them with Clang.

280
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,830
And to your knowledge, have you written
any programs for CS50 where there's

281
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,310
a back door of sorts, there's a way
that a bad guy, if running your program,

282
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,410
could take over your computer?

283
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,310
Probably not, right?

284
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,180
Mario, and Greedy, and Credit.

285
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,680
These are all pretty small programs.

286
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,910
You'd have to be pretty
bad if you actually

287
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,310
made your whole computer vulnerable
after writing 10 or 20 lines of code,

288
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,690
or at least unaware of some
of the security implications.

289
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,023
Now I say that facetiously,
but we're going to see today

290
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:54,600
and this week it's actually
really, really easy

291
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,980
to be bad and make even
short programs vulnerable.

292
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,880
>> But for now, at least, realize
that the question being asked here

293
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,850
is about Clang in a compiler.

294
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,360
Why have we been trusting Clang
for the past two or three weeks?

295
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,650
Who's to say that whoever wrote Clang
didn't have an "if" condition in there

296
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:17,680
that essentially injected some zeros
and ones into every program it compiles

297
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,180
that would let him or her access
your computer when you're asleep

298
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,580
and your laptop lid is open
and your computer is running?

299
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,080
Right?

300
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,350
We have this sort of honor system right
now where we trust that Clang is legit.

301
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,000
You trust that the appliance is legit.

302
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,430
You trust that literally every program
on your Mac or PC is trustworthy.

303
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,510
And as this simple bug suggests,
even if it's not malicious,

304
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,580
that's absolutely not
likely to be the case.

305
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,350
>> So you should be scared as hell.

306
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,560
Frankly, there's no simple
solution to this other

307
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,185
than a sort of societal awareness
of the increasing complexity

308
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:50,310
that we're building on top
of our computer systems,

309
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,740
and how increasingly vulnerable
we might very well be.

310
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,570
>> Now with that said, Breakout.

311
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:59,889
So Breakout is problem set three, and
Breakout is a game from yesteryear

312
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:02,180
that you might recall, but
for us in problem set three,

313
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,450
it allows us to take
things back up a notch

314
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,880
so that when we are writing programs,
even in a Terminal window like this,

315
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,670
we can actually run, ultimately,
graphical programs not

316
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,800
unlike those we had
access to in Scratch.

317
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,910
So this is the staff's
implementation of Breakout,

318
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,930
which is just this brick-breaking
game, that you move your paddle back

319
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,590
and forth, and you hit the ball
against those colored bricks up top.

320
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,020
So this is bringing us
sort of back to where

321
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,180
we were able to be very quickly
with Scratch, and now with C,

322
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,800
implementing our own
graphical user interfaces.

323
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,960
>> But more than that, this
problem set represents the first

324
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,000
in which we're giving
you a bunch of code.

325
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,940
And in fact, I bring explicit
attention to this, because especially

326
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,090
for those less comfortable, this
problem set, at least at first glance,

327
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,170
is going to feel like
we've taken it up a notch.

328
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,540
Because we've given you,
for some of the search

329
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,930
and sorting problems in the pset,
a bunch of code that we wrote,

330
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,680
and a couple of comments
that say "to do,"

331
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,221
where you have to fill in the blanks.

332
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:00,020
So not too scary, but
it's the first time

333
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,370
we're handing you code that you need to
first read, understand, and then add to

334
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,290
and complete it.

335
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,940
>> And then with Breakout,
we're going to do the same,

336
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,740
giving you a few dozen more lines
of code that, frankly, give you

337
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,490
a lot of the framework for
the game but stop short

338
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,304
of implementing the bricks
and the ball and the paddle,

339
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:15,970
but we do implement some other features.

340
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,280
And even that at first glance, again,
especially if less comfortable,

341
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,480
might seem particularly daunting and
you think there's so many new functions

342
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,070
you need to wrap your mind
around, and that's true.

343
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,281
But keep in mind, it's
quite like Scratch.

344
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:28,780
Odds are you didn't use all of
the puzzle pieces in Scratch.

345
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,120
Odds are you didn't care to wrap
your mind around all of them

346
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,617
because all it took was a
quick glance to understand, oh,

347
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,450
that's what I can do
with that puzzle piece.

348
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,260
And indeed, in problem set
3 spec, we'll point you

349
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,370
at the documentation that will
introduce you to some new functions,

350
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,570
and ultimately the programming
constructs you use.

351
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,610
Conditions, loops,
variables, and functions

352
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,720
will be identical to
what we've seen thus far.

353
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,560
>> So indeed, what we'll give
you is some sample code that

354
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,110
lets you create a window
that looks not unlike this,

355
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,540
and ultimately turn it into
something quite like this.

356
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,250
So take advantage of CS50,
discuss office hours and more,

357
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,290
and take comfort in the fact that
the amount of code you have to write

358
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,760
is actually not all that much.

359
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,359
The first challenge is just to acclimate
yourself to some code we've written.

360
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,450

361
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:15,810
>> Any questions on pset3,
Shellshock, or otherwise?

362
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:19,226
>> AUDIENCE: It seemed like
going through with Breakout

363
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:22,154
that the code is almost
an object-oriented style,

364
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:24,675
but I thought C was an
object-oriented program.

365
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,050
SPEAKER 1: An excellent question.

366
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,258
So in looking through the
distribution code, the code

367
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:30,180
we wrote for pset3,
for those familiar, it

368
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,230
looks like it's a
little object-oriented.

369
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,800
Short answer is, it is.

370
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,130
It's an approximation of how you
might do object-oriented code using

371
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,850
a language like C, but it is
still ultimately procedural.

372
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,900
There are no methods inside of
the variables, as you'll see.

373
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,180
But it is reminiscent of that.

374
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,780
And we'll see that feature again
when we get to PHP and JavaScript

375
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,946
toward the end the semester.

376
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:53,667
But for now, think of it as
a hint of what's to come.

377
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:54,250
Good question.

378
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,051

379
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:56,550
All right.

380
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,730
So merge sort was how we
left things last time.

381
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,250
And merge sort was cool in the
sense that it was so much faster,

382
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,100
at least based on the cursory tests
we did last week, than, say, bubble

383
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,710
sort, selection sort, insertion sort.

384
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,780
And what was neat too is just
how succinctly and cleanly

385
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,810
you can express it.

386
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,840
And what did we say it was an upper
bound on the running time of merge

387
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,340
sort?

388
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,633

389
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:18,495
Yeah?

390
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,360
>> AUDIENCE: n log n?

391
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,819
>> SPEAKER 1: n log n, right. n log n.

392
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:23,776
And we'll come back to what that
really means or where that comes from,

393
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:25,570
but this was better
than what running time

394
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,440
that we saw for bubble
selection and insertion sort?

395
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,610
So n squared. n squared
is bigger than this,

396
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,650
and even if it's not quite obvious,
know that log n is smaller than n,

397
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,910
so if you do n times
something smaller than n,

398
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,680
it's going to be less than n squared.

399
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,130
It's a bit of intuition there.

400
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,190
But we paid a price for this.

401
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:47,000
It was faster, but a theme that started
to emerge last week was this tradeoff.

402
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,804
I got better performance
time wise, but what

403
00:18:49,804 --> 00:18:52,470
did I have to spend on the other
hand, in order to achieve that?

404
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,591
>> AUDIENCE: Memory.

405
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,465
SPEAKER 1: Say again?

406
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:55,173
AUDIENCE: Memory.

407
00:18:55,173 --> 00:18:57,040
SPEAKER 1: Memory, or
space more generally.

408
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
And it wasn't super
obvious with our humans,

409
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,240
but recall that our volunteers
were stepping forward and stepping

410
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,780
back as though there's an array
here, and as though there's

411
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,130
a second array here that
they could use, because we

412
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,080
needed someplace to merge those folks.

413
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,480
We couldn't just swap them in place.

414
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,800
So merge sort leverage
is more space, which

415
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,620
we didn't need with
the other algorithms,

416
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,410
but the upside is that it's much faster.

417
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,780
And frankly, in the real world space
these days-- RAM, hard disk space--

418
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,030
is relatively cheap, and so that's
not necessarily a bad thing.

419
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,320
>> So let's take a quick look, a little
more methodically, at what we did

420
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,220
and why we said it was n log n.

421
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,260
So here are the eight numbers and the
eight volunteers we had last time.

422
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,718
And the first thing that Merge
Sort told us to do was what?

423
00:19:35,718 --> 00:19:37,010

424
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,010
AUDIENCE: Divide in two.

425
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,663
SPEAKER 1: Say again?

426
00:19:38,663 --> 00:19:39,650
AUDIENCE: Divide in two.

427
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,610
SPEAKER 1: Divide in two, right.

428
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,818
This is very reminiscent of
the phone book, of divide

429
00:19:42,818 --> 00:19:44,220
and conquer more generally.

430
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,640
So we looked at the left half.

431
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,700
And then once we said, sort
the left half of the elements,

432
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,690
what did we next say?

433
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,210

434
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,860
Sort the left half of the left
half, which allowed us to,

435
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,570
after dividing in two,
focus on four and two.

436
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,280
>> How do you sort a list now, in
yellow, of size two, using Merge Sort?

437
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,330

438
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,580
Well divide it in half,
and sort the left half.

439
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,100
And this was where things
got a little stupid briefly.

440
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,720
How do you sort a list that's of
size one, like this number four here?

441
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,330

442
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,210
It's sorted.

443
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,200
You're done.

444
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,300
>> But then how do you sort a list of
size one when it's the number two?

445
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,640
Well, same thing, but now what was the
third and the key step in Merge Sort?

446
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,020
You had to merge the left
half and the right half.

447
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,580
And once we did that, we looked
at four, we looked at two.

448
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,750
We decided all right,
obviously two comes first,

449
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,840
so we put two in its
place, followed by four.

450
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,010
And now you have to kind of rewind,
and this is sort of characteristic

451
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,570
of an algorithm like Merge
Sort, rewind in memory.

452
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,240
What was the next line of the story?

453
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,780
What should I be focusing on next?

454
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,110

455
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:47,350
The right half of the left
half, Which is six and eight.

456
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,320
>> So let me just step through this
without belaboring the point too much.

457
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,330
Six and eight, then six is
sorted, eight is sorted.

458
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,190
Merge them together like that,
and now the next big step

459
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,990
is, of course, sort the right half from
the very first step of this algorithm.

460
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,870
So we focus on one, three, seven, five.

461
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,540
We then focus on the left half.

462
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:09,400
The left half of that, the right half of
that, and then merge in one and three.

463
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,100
Then the right half, then left half
of it, then the right half of it.

464
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,985
Merge it in, and now what step remains?

465
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:18,040

466
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,460
Merge the big left half and the big
right half, so one goes down there,

467
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,330
then two, then three, then four, then
five, then six, then seven, then eight.

468
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:31,990
>> So now why is this ultimately revealing,
especially if n and logarithms more

469
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,487
generally rather escape you,
at least in recent memory?

470
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:37,070
Well, notice the height of this thing.

471
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,230
We had eight elements, and we
divided it by two, by two, by two.

472
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,590
So log base two of eight gives us three.

473
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,640

474
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,540
And trust me on that if
a little hazy on that.

475
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:54,710
But log base two of eight is three,
so we've done three layers of merging.

476
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,170
And when we merged
elements, how many elements

477
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,950
did we look at on each of those rows?

478
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,212

479
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:01,437
A total of n, right?

480
00:22:01,437 --> 00:22:04,020
Because to merge the top row,
even though we did it piecemeal,

481
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,990
we ultimately touched every number once.

482
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,054
And in the second row, to
merge those lists of size two,

483
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:10,470
we had to touch each element once.

484
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,690
And then here really
clearly in the last row,

485
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,430
we had to touch each of those
elements once, but only once,

486
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,400
so herein lies, then, our n log n.

487
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,780
>> And now just to make things a little
more formal for just a moment, if you

488
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,260
were to now analyze this
at a sort of higher level

489
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,340
and try to decide, well how
might you go about expressing

490
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,780
the running time of this algorithm
just by looking at it and not

491
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,590
by using a contrived example?

492
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,590
Well, how much time would you say a
step like this in yellow would take,

493
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,173
if n<2 return?

494
00:22:37,173 --> 00:22:38,840

495
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,830
That's a big O of what?

496
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,450

497
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,540
So I'm seeing one, so one step,
maybe two steps because it's if

498
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,110
and then return, but it's
constant time, right?

499
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,960
So we said O(1), and that's
how I'll express this.

500
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,480
T, just be running time.

501
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,150
n is the size of the input,
so T(n), just a fancy way

502
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,330
of saying the running
time given input of size n

503
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,220
is going to be on the order
of constant time, in O(1).

504
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,970
>> But otherwise, what about this?

505
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,660
How would you express the
running time of this yellow line?

506
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,250
T of what?

507
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,440

508
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,665
You can kind of cheat here and
answer my question cyclically.

509
00:23:12,665 --> 00:23:14,770

510
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,900
So if the running time in
general we just say is T(n).

511
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,950

512
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,490
And now you're kind of punting here and
saying, well, just sort the left half,

513
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,920
and then sort the right half.

514
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,520
How might we symbolically represent
the running time of this yellow line?

515
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,020
T of what?

516
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,360
What's the size of the input?

517
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,510

518
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,057
n over two.

519
00:23:31,057 --> 00:23:32,140
Why don't I just say that?

520
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,449
And then this is another T(n/2) and then
again, if I merge two sorted halves,

521
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:38,615
how many elements am I going
to have to touch total?

522
00:23:38,615 --> 00:23:39,780

523
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,320
n.

524
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,790
So I can express this,
just to be kind of fancy,

525
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,430
as the running time in general.

526
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:51,140
T(n) is just the running time of T(n/2),
plus T(n/2), left half and right half,

527
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,360
plus O(n), which is probably n steps,
but maybe, if I'm using two fingers,

528
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,960
it's twice as many
steps, but it's linear.

529
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,440
It's some number of steps
that's a factor of n,

530
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,270
so we might express this as this.

531
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:05,550
And this is where now we'll punt to the
back of our high school math textbook

532
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:10,290
we're that recurrence ultimately
ends up equaling this, n times log n,

533
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,530
if you actually do out
the math more formally.

534
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,950
>> So that's just two perspectives.

535
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,500
One numerically with a
hard-coded representative example

536
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,140
using eight numbers, and a more
general look at how we got there.

537
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,670
But what's really interesting here
is, again, this notion of cycling.

538
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,900
I'm not using for loops.

539
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,860
I'm kind of defining
something in terms of itself,

540
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,950
not only with this
mathematical function,

541
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,860
but also in terms of this pseudo code.

542
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,260
This pseudo code is recursive
in that two of its lines

543
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:42,310
is essentially telling it to go
use itself to solve a smaller

544
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,400
problem of smaller size,
and then again and again

545
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,820
and again until we whittle it
down to this so-called base case.

546
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,810
>> So let's actually draw a more compelling
take-away from this as follows.

547
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:58,420
Let me go into gedit and take a
look at some of today's source code,

548
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,930
in particular this example here.

549
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,709
Sigma 0, which apparently adds
the numbers one through n.

550
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,750
So let's see what's familiar
and unfamiliar here.

551
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,690
First we have a couple of
includes, so nothing new there.

552
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,190
Prototype.

553
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,370
I'm a little hazy on
this after few days,

554
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,790
but what did we say a
prototype of a function is?

555
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,099

556
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:16,015
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

557
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:16,905
SPEAKER 1: What's that?

558
00:25:16,905 --> 00:25:17,800
AUDIENCE: We announce it.

559
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,883
SPEAKER 1: We announce it.

560
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:22,290
So you are teaching Clang, hey,
not actually implementing this yet,

561
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,740
but somewhere in this file, presumably,
is going to be a function called what?

562
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,930

563
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,540
Sigma.

564
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,540
And this is just a promise that
it's going to look like this.

565
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,720
It's going to take an integer as
input-- and I can be more explicit

566
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,570
and say int n --and it's
going to return an int,

567
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,900
but semicolon means, mm, I'll get around
to implementing this a little later.

568
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,989
Again, Clang is dumb.

569
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:43,280
It's only going to know what
you tell it top to bottom,

570
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,765
so we need to at least give
it a hint of what's to come.

571
00:25:45,765 --> 00:25:47,330
>> Now let's look at main here.

572
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,040
Let's scroll down here and
see what main is doing.

573
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,780
It's not that long of a function, and
in fact the construct here is familiar.

574
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:57,590
I declare a variable n, and then
I pester the user again and again

575
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,880
for a positive integer using getInt,
and only exit out of this loop

576
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,280
once the user has complied.

577
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,670
Do While, we've used to
pester the user in that way.

578
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,670
Now this is interesting.

579
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,510
I declare an int called "answer."

580
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,420
I assign it the return value
of a function called "sigma."

581
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,200
I don't know what that does yet, but
I remember declaring it a moment ago.

582
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,310
And then I'm passing in the
value that the user typed in, n,

583
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,420
and then I report the answer.

584
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,260
Well let's scroll back
for just a moment.

585
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:28,620
Let's go ahead into this directory, make
sigma 0, and actually run this program

586
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,490
and see what happens.

587
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:35,930
So if I go ahead and run
this program, ./sigma-0,

588
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,139
and I type in a positive
integer like two, Sigma,

589
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:43,180
as the Greek symbol implies, is just
going to add up all the numbers from

590
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,320
zero on up to two.

591
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,560
So 0 plus 1 plus 2.

592
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,830
So this should hopefully give me 3.

593
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,750
That's all it's doing.

594
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,690
And similarly, if I run this again
and I give it the number three,

595
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:56,721
that's 3 plus 2, so that's
5, plus 1 should give me 6.

596
00:26:56,721 --> 00:26:59,470
And then if I get really crazy and
start typing in bigger numbers,

597
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,290
it should give me
bigger and bigger sums.

598
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,250
So that's all.

599
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,010
>> So what does sigma look like?

600
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,430
Well, it's pretty straightforward.

601
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,940
It's how we might have implemented
this for the past couple of weeks.

602
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,120
"int" is going to be the return type.

603
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,330
Sigma is the name, and it takes
a variable m instead of n.

604
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,940
I'll change that up top.

605
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,340
Then this is just a sanity check.

606
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,430

607
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,950
We'll see why in a moment.

608
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,220
Now I declare another variable,
sum, initialize it to zero.

609
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:28,140
Then I have this For loop
iterating, apparently for clarity,

610
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,810
from i=1 on up to an =m, which is
whatever the user typed in, and then I

611
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,690
increment the sum like this.

612
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,360
And then return the sum.

613
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,440
>> So a couple of questions.

614
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,370
One, I claim in my comment that this
avoids risk of an infinite loop.

615
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,620
Why would passing in a negative number
induce, potentially, an infinite loop?

616
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,396

617
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:51,290
>> AUDIENCE: You'll never reach m.

618
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,880
>> SPEAKER 1: Never reach m.

619
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,880
But m is passed in, so let's
consider a simple example.

620
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,510
If m is passed in by the
user as negative one.

621
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,059
Irrespective of main.

622
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,850
Main protects us from
this too, so I'm just

623
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,680
being really anal with
sigma to also make sure

624
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,540
that the input can't be negative.

625
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,130
So if m is negative,
something like negative one.

626
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,930
What's going to happen?

627
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,390
Well, i is going to
get initialized to one,

628
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,060
and then i is going to be
less than or equal to m?

629
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:24,130

630
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:24,765
>> Stand by.

631
00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:26,930

632
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,370
That was-- let's not,
let's nix this story.

633
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,780
I didn't ask that question, because
the risk that I am alluding to

634
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:38,360
is not going to happen because i is
always going be greater than-- OK,

635
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,871
I retract that question.

636
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:40,370
OK.

637
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,030
Let's focus only on this part here.

638
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,210

639
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:48,830
Why did I declare some
outside of the loop?

640
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:52,010
Notice on line 49 I've
declared i inside of the loop,

641
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,950
but online 48 I've
declared some outside.

642
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,695
Yeah.

643
00:28:55,695 --> 00:28:56,611
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

644
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:58,734

645
00:28:58,734 --> 00:28:59,400
SPEAKER 1: Sure.

646
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,360
So first and foremost I certainly don't
want to declare and initialize sum

647
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,130
to zero inside of the
loop on every iteration,

648
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:09,370
because this would clearly defeat the
purpose of summing up the numbers.

649
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,770
I would keep changing
the value back to zero.

650
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:17,992
And also, what's another more arcane
reason for that same design decision?

651
00:29:17,992 --> 00:29:18,954
Yeah.

652
00:29:18,954 --> 00:29:20,279
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

653
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,070
SPEAKER 1: Exactly.

654
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,060
I want to access it outside
of the loop too on what line?

655
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,390

656
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,400
On 53.

657
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,910
And based on our rule of thumb
from a couple of lectures ago,

658
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:33,680
variables are scoped, really, to the
curly braces that encompass them.

659
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,190
So if I don't declare sum inside
of these outer curly braces,

660
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,250
I can't use it in line 53.

661
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,160
Put another way, if I declared
sum in here, or even within the

662
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,410
For loop, I could not access it in 53.

663
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,150
The variable would effectively be gone.

664
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,579
So a couple of reasons there.

665
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,370
But now let's go back
and see what happens.

666
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,730
So sigma gets called.

667
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:55,640
It adds up 1 plus 2, or 1 plus 2
plus 3, and then returns the value,

668
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,660
stores it in answer, and printf here
is why I'm seeing on the screen.

669
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,079
So this is what we'll call an iterative
approach, where iteration just

670
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:03,870
means using a loop.

671
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,900
A For loop, a While loop, a Do While
loop, just doing something again

672
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,380
and again and again.

673
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:13,505
>> But sigma is kind of a neat function in
that I could implement it differently.

674
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:14,620

675
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:19,120
What about this, which
just to be kind of cool,

676
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,880
let me really get rid
of a lot of distraction

677
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,380
because this function
is really quite simple.

678
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,780
Let's whittle it down just
to its four core lines

679
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,410
and get rid of all the
comments and curly braces.

680
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,334
This is kind of a mind-blowing
alternative implementation.

681
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:37,250
All right, maybe not mind-blowing,
but it's kind of sexier, all right,

682
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,920
to look at this so much more succinctly.

683
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,120
With just four lines of code,
I first have this sanity check.

684
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,732
If m is less than or equal to
zero, sigma makes no sense.

685
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:48,190
It's only supposed to be in
this case for positive numbers,

686
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,340
so I'm just going to
return zero arbitrarily

687
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,210
so that we at least have
some so-called base case.

688
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,430
>> But here's the beauty.

689
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:59,930
The entirety of this idea, adding the
numbers from 1 to n, or m in this case,

690
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,630
can be done by kind of passing the buck.

691
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,947
Well, what is the sum of 1 to m?

692
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:05,780
Well, you know what?

693
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:11,949
It's the same as the sum of m
plus the sum of 1 to m minus 1.

694
00:31:11,949 --> 00:31:12,740
Well you know what?

695
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,940
What's sigma of m minus 1?

696
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,860
Well, if you kind of follow this
logically, it's the same as m minus 1

697
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,415
plus sigma of m minus 2.

698
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:22,480

699
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,012
So you can kind of just--
this is like, if you're just

700
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:28,220
trying to annoy a friend
and they ask you a question,

701
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,344
you kind of respond with a question,
you can kind of keep passing the buck.

702
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:34,560
But what's key is that if you keep
making the question smaller and smaller

703
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,910
and smaller, you're
not asking what's sigma

704
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,116
of n, what's sigma of
n, what's sigma of n?

705
00:31:39,116 --> 00:31:40,990
You're asking what's
sigma of n, what's sigma

706
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,839
of n minus 1, what's sigma of n minus 2?

707
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,880
Eventually your question
is going to become what?

708
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,250
What is sigma of one or
zero, some very small value,

709
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,220
and as soon as you
get that, your friend,

710
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,350
you are not going to ask
the same question again,

711
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,975
you're just going to say, oh it's zero.

712
00:31:55,975 --> 00:31:58,490
We're done playing this sort
of stupid cyclical game.

713
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,950
>> So recursion is the act in programming
of a function calling itself.

714
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,630
This program, when compiled and run, is
going to behave exactly the same way,

715
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,620
but what's key is that inside
of a function called sigma,

716
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,150
there is a line of code wherein
we're calling ourselves,

717
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,980
which would normally be bad.

718
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:21,160
For instance, what if I first
compiled this, so make sigma--

719
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,710
make sigma 1 ./sigma-1.

720
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:25,050

721
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,690
Positive integer, please, 50 1275.

722
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,810
So what the function seems to
be, based on one test, correct.

723
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:34,917
But what if I get a little dangerous
and delete the so-called base case,

724
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:37,750
and just say, well I'm just making
this more complicated than it is.

725
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:42,450
Let's just compute the sigma
by taking m and then adding

726
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,564
in sigma of m minus one?

727
00:32:44,564 --> 00:32:45,980
Well, what's going to happen here?

728
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,140
Let's zoom out.

729
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:52,920
Let's recompile the program,
save it, recompile the program,

730
00:32:52,920 --> 00:33:00,450
and then ready ./sigma-1 zooming in,
enter positive integer please, 50.

731
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,180

732
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,430
How many of you are willing
to fess up to seeing that?

733
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:04,950
>> OK.

734
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,690
So this can happen for
a number of reasons,

735
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,148
and frankly this week we're
about to give you more of them.

736
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:11,780
But in this case, try
to reason backwards

737
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,430
what might have happened here?

738
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:17,400
Segmentation fault, we said last
time, refers to a segment of memory.

739
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,690
Something bad happened.

740
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,550
But what was it
mechanically that went awry

741
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:25,000
here because of my removal
of that so-called base case,

742
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,870
where I returned a hard-coded value?

743
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,970

744
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,460
What do you think went wrong?

745
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,219
Yeah.

746
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:32,135
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

747
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:36,387

748
00:33:36,387 --> 00:33:36,970
SPEAKER 1: Ah.

749
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:37,550
Good question.

750
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,508
So the size of the number
that I was summing up

751
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:41,920
got so big that it exceeded
the size of the memory space.

752
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,640
Good idea, but not fundamentally
going to cause a crash.

753
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,230
That might cause integer overflow,
where the bits just flip over

754
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,760
and then we mistake a really big
number for like a negative number,

755
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,260
but that itself won't cause a crash.

756
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,509
Because at the end of the
day an int is still 32 bits.

757
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:57,640
You're not going to
accidentally steal a 33rd bit.

758
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,431
But a good thought.

759
00:33:58,431 --> 00:33:58,984
Yeah.

760
00:33:58,984 --> 00:33:59,900
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

761
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,551

762
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:02,300
SPEAKER 1: The method
never stops running,

763
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,658
and indeed it calls itself again
and again and again and again

764
00:34:06,658 --> 00:34:08,449
and again, and none of
those functions ever

765
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:13,310
finish because their sole line of
code calls themself again and again

766
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,219
and again.

767
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,080
And what's really
happening here, and now we

768
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,100
can kind of draw this pictorially.

769
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,899
Let me go over to a
picture for just a moment.

770
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:22,940
This is a picture, that
will eventually flesh out

771
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,336
in more detail, of what's going on
inside of your computer's memory.

772
00:34:26,336 --> 00:34:28,460
And it turns out that on
the bottom of this picture

773
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,709
is something called the stack.

774
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:31,920
This is a chunk of
memory, a chunk of RAM,

775
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,920
that's just used any time
a function is called.

776
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,239
Any time you, a programmer,
call a function,

777
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,860
the operating system, like
Mac OS, Windows, or Linux,

778
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,920
grabs a bunch of bytes, maybe a
few kilobytes, maybe few megabytes

779
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,590
of memory, hands them
to you, and then lets

780
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,650
you run your function using
whatever variables you need.

781
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,699
And if you then call another
function and another function,

782
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:53,590
you get another slice of memory
and another slice of memory.

783
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:57,090
>> And indeed, if these green trays
from Annenberg represent that memory,

784
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,870
here's what happens the first
time you call function sigma.

785
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:04,510
It's like putting a tray like this
on what's initially an empty stack.

786
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,142
But then if that tray
calls itself, so to speak,

787
00:35:07,142 --> 00:35:08,850
calling another instance
of sigma, that's

788
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,640
like asking the operating system,
ooh, need a little more memory,

789
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,520
give me that.

790
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,840
And then it gets piled on on top.

791
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,030
But what's key here is that
the first tray is still there,

792
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,620
because he invoked this second tray.

793
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,500
Now meanwhile, sigma call sigma,
that's like asking for more memory.

794
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,830
Gets piled on over here.

795
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:29,350
sigma call sigma, that's another
tray that gets piled on here.

796
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:32,942
And if you keep doing this,
eventually, kind of map this visual

797
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:35,525
to that chart, what's going to
happen with the stack of trays?

798
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:37,480

799
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,160
It is going to exceed the amount
of memory your computer has.

800
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,790
And as soon as this green tray
exceeds the horizontal line

801
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:49,410
above stack and above that word heap,
which we'll come back to in the future,

802
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,410
that is a bad thing.

803
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,810
The heap is a different
segment of memory,

804
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,190
and if you let these
trays pile and pile on,

805
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,800
you're going to exceed
your own segment of memory,

806
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,420
and a program is indeed going to crash.

807
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,930
>> Now as an aside, this idea
of recursion, therefore,

808
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:06,500
can clearly lead to problems, but
it's not necessarily a bad thing.

809
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,840
Because consider, after
all, how-- and maybe

810
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,700
this takes some getting used
to --how elegant or how simple

811
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,890
that implementation of sigma was.

812
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,440
And we're not going to use
recursion all that much in CS50,

813
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,780
but in CS51, and really any class
where you manipulate data structures

814
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,640
like trees, or family trees,
that have some hierarchy,

815
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,000
it's super, super useful.

816
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,750
Now, as an aside, so that you
as aspiring computer scientists

817
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,180
are familiar with some of Google's
inside jokes, if you go to Google

818
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,345
and you look up what is the
definition of, say, recursion, enter.

819
00:36:36,345 --> 00:36:40,208

820
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:41,110
Uh-huh.

821
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,670
As an aside, I pulled up a few.

822
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,470
This was like 10 minutes of
procrastination this morning.

823
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:52,890
If you also Google "askew," notice
by tilting your head slightly--

824
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,120
and then this one is perhaps
most atrocious of all

825
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,286
since someone spent like
their day implementing this

826
00:36:57,286 --> 00:36:59,880
some years ago-- come on.

827
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,140

828
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,540
Oh, wait-- that's a bug.

829
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,410

830
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,410
>> So running on one of the
world's biggest websites

831
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,510
are these stupid little Easter eggs.

832
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,690
They probably consume a
nontrivial number of lines of code

833
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:19,280
just so that we can have
little fun things like that.

834
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,140
But at least now you get
some of those inside jokes.

835
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:28,330
>> Now let's take a look at some of the
white lies we've been telling of late,

836
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,707
and start to peel back
some layers technically

837
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,790
so that you really understand
what's been going on

838
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,860
and you can understand
some of the threats,

839
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,060
like Shellshock, that
have now started to become

840
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:41,110
on the forefront of everyone's
attention, at least in the media.

841
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:45,810
So here is a very simple function
that returns nothing, void.

842
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,790
Its name is swap.

843
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:50,880
It takes in two variables
and it returns nothing.

844
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,260
Takes in a and b .

845
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,337
So a quick demonstration.

846
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,170
We brought these up.

847
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,100
We might as well take a little
break here for just a moment

848
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,250
and have a little something to drink.

849
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,120
If someone wouldn't mind joining
me up here for just a moment.

850
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,830
How about you in the maroon shirt?

851
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,335
Come on up.

852
00:38:02,335 --> 00:38:04,060

853
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,260
Just the one today.

854
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,251
Thank you, though.

855
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:08,000
All right, and we have
coming up who here?

856
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,660
What's your name?

857
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,360
>> SPEAKER 4: Laura.

858
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:09,740
>> SPEAKER 1: Laura.

859
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,370
Come on up.

860
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,460

861
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,850
So Laura, very simple challenge today.

862
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,704

863
00:38:14,704 --> 00:38:15,370
Nice to meet yo.

864
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,410

865
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:16,910
All right.

866
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:21,179
So we have some milk over here and
we have some orange juice over here

867
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:23,345
and some cups that we
borrowed from Annenberg today.

868
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:24,178
>> SPEAKER 4: Borrowed.

869
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:27,240
SPEAKER 1: And going to go ahead
and give you half a glass of this.

870
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,250

871
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:28,800
All right.

872
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,750
And we'll give you half
a glass of the milk.

873
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,905

874
00:38:31,905 --> 00:38:35,890
Oh, and just so that you can
remember what this was like,

875
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,860
I remembered to bring
this up and on today.

876
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,030

877
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:42,530
Okay.

878
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,470
If you wouldn't mind, let's see, we
can put them over your own glasses

879
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,560
if you want.

880
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,710
This'll be the world from Laura's eyes.

881
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,210
All right.

882
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,820
So your goal, given two cups of
liquid here, milk and orange juice,

883
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,370
is swap the two contents so that the
orange juice goes into the milk cup

884
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,710
and the milk goes into
the orange juice cup.

885
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,359
>> SPEAKER 4: Do I get another cup?

886
00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:05,650
SPEAKER 1: I'm so glad you asked, though
it would have been much better footage

887
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,710
if you hadn't asked.

888
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,620
But yes, we can offer you a third
cup that's empty, of course.

889
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,120
All right.

890
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,300
So swap the contents there.

891
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,100

892
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,050
Very nice.

893
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,390

894
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,305
Very good.

895
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:23,121

896
00:39:23,121 --> 00:39:24,745
You're doing this remarkably carefully.

897
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:26,970

898
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,655
And step three.

899
00:39:28,655 --> 00:39:30,390

900
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,350
All right.

901
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:31,930
Excellent.

902
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,930
A big round of applause
would be good for Laura.

903
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,500

904
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,000
All right.

905
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,790
We have a little parting gift
for you, but let me take these.

906
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,620
Thank you so much.

907
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,170
So a simple example, though,
to demonstrate that if you do

908
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,300
want to swap the contents
of two containers,

909
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,360
or let's call them variables,
you need some temporary storage

910
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,710
to stage one of the contents in so
that you can actually do the swap.

911
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:01,790
So indeed, this source code up here in
C is representative of exactly that.

912
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:06,340
If the orange juice was a and the milk
was b, and we wanted to swap the two,

913
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,990
you could try something creative
by pouring one into the other,

914
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,031
but that probably wouldn't
end particularly well.

915
00:40:11,031 --> 00:40:15,260
And so we use a third cup, call
it tmp, T-M-P by convention,

916
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,370
and put the contents of the
OJ in that, then swap one cup,

917
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,610
then put the OJ into the
original cup, thereby

918
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:25,320
achieving, exactly as
Laura did, the swap.

919
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,850
>> So let's do exactly that.

920
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,110
Let me go ahead and open
up an example that's

921
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,720
actually called "no
swap," because this is not

922
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,180
as simply done as you might think.

923
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:41,190
So in this program, notice that
I'm using stdio.h, our old friend.

924
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,130
I have the prototype
for swap up there, which

925
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,450
means its implementation's
probably down below,

926
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,050
and let's see what this main
program's going to do for me.

927
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:52,020
I first declare int x gets
one, and int y gets two.

928
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,930
So think of those as OJ
and milk, respectively.

929
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,100
And then I just have a
printf saying x is this

930
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,120
and y is this, just so I can
visually see what's going on.

931
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,810
Then I have printf claiming
that I'm swapping the two,

932
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:07,100
and then I print out a
claim that they're swapped,

933
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,300
and I print out x and y again.

934
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,010
So down here in swap is
exactly what Laura did,

935
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:16,240
and exactly what we saw on
the screen a moment ago.

936
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,380
>> So let's go ahead and
be sorely disappointed.

937
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:24,690
Make no swap, and run no swap,
zooming in on the output here.

938
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:28,320
Enter x is 1, y is 2, swapping swapped.

939
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,700
x is still 1, and y is still 2.

940
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,630
So even though, frankly, this looks
exactly like, albeit more technically,

941
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,730
what Laura did, didn't seem to work.

942
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,130
So why is that?

943
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:46,630
Well, it turns out that when
we write a program like this

944
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:51,590
that has both main, highlighted here,
and then another function, like swap,

945
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,230
highlighted here, which
it calls, the world

946
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:57,030
looks a little something like
these trays a moment ago.

947
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,440
When main first gets called,
that's like asking operating system

948
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,030
for a bit of memory for any local
variables like x and y that main has,

949
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,660
and they end up right there.

950
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:10,920
But if main calls swap, and main
passes to swap two arguments, a and b,

951
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:16,410
orange juice and milk, it's not like
handing the orange juice and the milk

952
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,500
to Laura.

953
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,300
What a computer does, is it
passes copies of the orange juice

954
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:27,110
and copies of the milk to Laura, so that
what's ultimately inside of this tray

955
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:32,510
is the value one and two, or OJ
and milk, but copies thereof,

956
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,790
so that at this point
in the story, there

957
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,930
is OJ and milk in each of these trays.

958
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,260
There's a one and a two
in each of these trays,

959
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,720
and the swap function is indeed working.

960
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,090
It's swapping them inside
of the second topmost tray,

961
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:48,147
but that swapping has no impact.

962
00:42:48,147 --> 00:42:49,980
And based on just some
basic principle we've

963
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,970
talked about before, and indeed
just a few minutes ago, what

964
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:58,770
might explain why changing
a and b inside of swap

965
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:05,560
has no effect on x and y, even though
I passed x and y to the swap function.

966
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,750
What's the key word here that
might simplistically explain?

967
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,250

968
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,627
I think I heard it here?

969
00:43:12,627 --> 00:43:13,335
AUDIENCE: Return.

970
00:43:13,335 --> 00:43:14,085
SPEAKER 1: Return?

971
00:43:14,085 --> 00:43:14,590
Not return.

972
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:15,895
Let's go with one other.

973
00:43:15,895 --> 00:43:16,395
What's that?

974
00:43:16,395 --> 00:43:17,080
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

975
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,000
>> SPEAKER 1: OK, so return-- we could
make return work in the story,

976
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,914
but there's an even simpler explanation.

977
00:43:21,914 --> 00:43:22,580
AUDIENCE: Scope.

978
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,288
SPEAKER 1: Scope.

979
00:43:23,288 --> 00:43:24,300
I'll take scope.

980
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,290
So scope, remember where
our x and y declared.

981
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:30,840
They're declared inside
of main right up here.

982
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,200
a and b, meanwhile, are
effectively declared

983
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,930
inside of swap, not quite in
the curly braces but still

984
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,690
in the general area of swap.

985
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,560
And so indeed, a and b
only exist within this tray

986
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,850
from Annenberg, this
second chunk of code.

987
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:49,500
So we're indeed changing the copy, but
that's not really all that helpful.

988
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,190
>> So let's take a look at
this a little lower level.

989
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:55,430
I'm going to go back into
the Source Directory,

990
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:58,330
and I'm going to first
zoom in here, and just

991
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:02,290
to confirm that I'm in this
bigger terminal window,

992
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:04,430
the program's still behaving like that.

993
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,840
Suppose now that this
is not intentional.

994
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,090
Clearly I wanted swap to
work, so it feels like a bug.

995
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,780
Now I could start adding a
lot of printf's to my code,

996
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,010
printing out x over here, y over
here, a over here, b over here.

997
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,220
But frankly, that's probably what
you've been doing for a couple of weeks

998
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,190
now, in office hours
and at home when working

999
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,150
on psets trying to find some bugs.

1000
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:25,560
But you'll see, if you haven't already,
that problem set three introduces you

1001
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:31,630
to a command called GDB,
where GDB, GNU debugger,

1002
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:34,040
has itself a whole bunch of
features that can actually

1003
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,160
let us understand situations
like this, but more compellingly,

1004
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,940
solve problems and find bugs.

1005
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,940
So I'm going to do this.

1006
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,770
Instead of ./noswap, I'm instead
going to run GDB ./noswap.

1007
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:47,410

1008
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:51,200
In other words, I'm going to run my
program not in Bash, our new friend

1009
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:51,850
today.

1010
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,970
I'm going to run my
program noswap inside

1011
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,900
of this other program called
GDB, which is a debugger, which

1012
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,035
is a program that's designed to help
you humans find and remove bugs.

1013
00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:03,410
So if I hit Run here, there's
an atrocious amount of text

1014
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:04,868
that you really never have to read.

1015
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,290
It's essentially a distraction
from the prompt, which

1016
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:10,030
I'm going to hit Control-L
to get up at the top there.

1017
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,800
This is the GDB prompt.

1018
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,550
If I want to run this program now,
as this little cheat sheet on today's

1019
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:21,860
slide suggests, Run is the first
commands that we meant to introduce.

1020
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:25,150
And I'm just going to type
run up here inside of GDB,

1021
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:26,811
and indeed it ran my program.

1022
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:29,310
Now there's some additional
outputs of the screen like this,

1023
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,910
but that's GDB just being anal
and telling us what's going on.

1024
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,451
You don't really have to worry
about these details right now.

1025
00:45:34,451 --> 00:45:36,890
But what's really cool about
GDB, if I do this again--

1026
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:42,100
Control-L clears the screen-- let me go
ahead and type "break main," thereby,

1027
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,743
when I hit Enter, setting what's
called a break point at noswap.c,

1028
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:51,270
line 16, which is where GDB
figured out my program actually

1029
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:53,070
is, my function actually is.

1030
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,070
This we'll ignore for now
but that's the address

1031
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:57,310
in memory specifically of this function.

1032
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:00,240
So now when I type run,
notice what's cool here.

1033
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,650
My program breaks at the line I
told GDB to pause execution at.

1034
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:09,850
So I don't have to now change my code,
add some printf's, recompile it, rerun

1035
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,300
it, change, add some printf's,
save it, recompile it, run it.

1036
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:18,100
I can just walk through my program
step by step by step at human speed,

1037
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,880
not at Intel-inside kind of speed.

1038
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,580
>> So now notice this line
appears here, and if I go back

1039
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,800
to my program in gedit,
notice that that is actually

1040
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,280
the very first line of code.

1041
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,240
There's line 16 in gedit.

1042
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,610
There's line 16 within GDB, and even
though this black and white interface

1043
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:37,760
isn't nearly as user
friendly, this means

1044
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,680
that line 16 hasn't been executed
yet, but it's about to be.

1045
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,220
So indeed if I type print
x, not printf, just print x,

1046
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,730
I get some bogus value there of zero,
because x hasn't been initialized yet.

1047
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:54,760
So I'm going to type next, or, if you
want to be fancy, just n for next.

1048
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,090
But when I type next enter, now
notice it moves on to line 17.

1049
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:02,840
So logically, if I've executed
line 16 and I now type print x,

1050
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,640
what should I see?

1051
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,970

1052
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:05,520
One.

1053
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,820
>> And now this is admittedly confusing.

1054
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:11,260
$2 is just a fancy way of, if you
want to refer to that value later,

1055
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,510
you can say "dollar sign two."

1056
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:13,480
It's like a back reference.

1057
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,570
But for now, just ignore it.

1058
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:17,070
What's interesting is what's
on the right of the equal sign.

1059
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:21,000
And now if I type next again
and print y, I should see 2.

1060
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,870
I can also now print
x again, and frankly,

1061
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:27,130
if I'm getting a little confused as to
where I am, I can type list for list

1062
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:30,590
and just see some context around
the point I'm actually at.

1063
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:35,180
And now I can type
next, and there x is 1.

1064
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,300
Now I type next.

1065
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,710
Oh, y is 2.

1066
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:40,750
And again, it is confusing,
because GDB's output

1067
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,044
is being commingled with my own output.

1068
00:47:43,044 --> 00:47:45,710
But if you keep in mind, by
glancing back and forth at your code

1069
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:47,740
or laying it out side
by side perhaps, you'll

1070
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:51,020
see that really I'm just
stepping through my program.

1071
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,620
>> But notice what happens next, literally.

1072
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,380
Here's line 22.

1073
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:01,315
Let me go over it, thereby moving on
to 23, and if I print x now, still one.

1074
00:48:01,315 --> 00:48:03,890
And if I print y now, still one.

1075
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:05,820
So this is not a useful exercise.

1076
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,450
So let's redo this.

1077
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:10,069
Let me go back up to the
top and type run again.

1078
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:12,110
And it's saying the program
that's being debugged

1079
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:14,109
has started already,
started from the beginning.

1080
00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:15,420
Yes, let's do this again.

1081
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:22,000
And this time let's do next,
next, next, next, next,

1082
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,180
but now things get interesting.

1083
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,760
Now I want to step into
swap, so I don't type next.

1084
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:34,380
I type step, and now notice it
has jumped me to noswap.c line 33.

1085
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,240
If I go back to gedit, what's line 33?

1086
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,500
That's the first actual
line of code inside of swap.

1087
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,150
Which is nice, because now I can
kind of poke around and get curious

1088
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,052
as to what's going on truly in there.

1089
00:48:46,052 --> 00:48:46,760
Let me print tmp.

1090
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,770

1091
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:48,800
Whoa.

1092
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,438
Why does tmp have some
crazy, bogus garbage value?

1093
00:48:51,438 --> 00:48:54,579

1094
00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:56,120
AUDIENCE: It hasn't been initialized.

1095
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,150
SPEAKER 1: It hasn't been initialized.

1096
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:00,270
And indeed, when you run a program,
you're given a whole bunch of memory

1097
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,392
by the operating system, but you
haven't initialized any values,

1098
00:49:03,392 --> 00:49:05,600
so whatever bits you're
seeing here, even though it's

1099
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,770
this crazy big negative
number, just means

1100
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:10,750
that those are the remnants from
some previous usage of that RAM,

1101
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,050
even though I haven't
myself needed it yet.

1102
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:17,086
So now I'm going to go ahead and type
next, and if I now type print tmp,

1103
00:49:17,086 --> 00:49:17,835
what should I see?

1104
00:49:17,835 --> 00:49:19,570

1105
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:23,360
Whatever the value of a was,
a is the first argument, just

1106
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,550
like x was the first
thing being passed in,

1107
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:30,450
so a and x should be the same,
so print tmp should print me one.

1108
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:36,360
>> So what you'll see in problem set
three is a tutorial of sorts on GDB,

1109
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:40,020
but realize that this is the beginning
of a look at a tool that will actually

1110
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,774
help you solve problems
so much more effectively.

1111
00:49:42,774 --> 00:49:44,690
What we're ultimately
going to do on Wednesday

1112
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,180
is start to peel back a few layers
and remove some training wheels.

1113
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,496
That thing called string that
we've used for some time,

1114
00:49:50,496 --> 00:49:53,370
we're going to slowly take that away
from you and start talking about

1115
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,725
something more esoterically
known as char*,

1116
00:49:55,725 --> 00:49:59,550
but we're going to do this nice and
gently at first, even though pointers,

1117
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:02,730
as they're called, can do some
very bad things if abused,

1118
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:06,040
by looking at a little claymation from
our friend Nick Parlante from Stanford

1119

science who put together this preview

1120
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:11,075
of what's to come this Wednesday.
