of staff in particular.

77
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,090
This here is Ansel Duff,
who is actually one

78
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,860
of the co-authors of these binary
bulbs that we saw on Wednesday,

79
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,710
in addition to CS50's own Dan Bradley.

80
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,094
Ansel Duff was also a former
freshman advisee of mine 3 years ago

81
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,760
and he actually even built this lectern.

82
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,330
He's gone on to do
engineering sciences and more.

83
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,279
Now, his picture here is actually
Ansel 3 years ago at the CS50 Hackathon

84
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,820
when he borrowed one of our
balloons, stuck it to his laptop,

85
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,240
and, for the next 12 some odd
hours, focused on his final project,

86
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,150
taking breaks only to open
bags of candy at the Hackathon.

87
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,210
>> But he went on more recently to
spend this past summer with us,

88
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,270
since CS50 for its staff, and
now students this semester,

89
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,770
has its own 3D printer.

90
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,180
And in a nutshell a 3D printers is
a device that looks quite like this.

91
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,700
You fill it with a plastic spool
that is melted down by the device

92
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,940
and you build things
literally from nothing.

93
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,660
Much like an inkjet printer, you start
spitting out little dots of plastic

94
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,990
that form together to
form whole objects.

95
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,430
And so Ansel for instance, earlier
this summer, has an iPhone 5

96
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,722
and decided he really wanted
to prop it up on his desk.

97
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,638
But he didn't want to
go out and buy something

98
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:36,030
from the Apple store or the like, so he
sat down and started drawing something.

99
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,280
He took a few measurements
as to how thick

100
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,270
and how wide his iPhone was,
he drew this image here,

101
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,870
he decided that he wanted
to have a 75 degree tilt

102
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,150
as it was staring at
him on his desk there.

103
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,440
He then turned this, using
software, into a 3D CAD model

104
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,400
that looked a little
something like this.

105
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,940
And then he proceeded,
ultimately, to actually create it.

106
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,250
So in fact, if any of you here, perhaps
in a row that I can throw to, have

107
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:06,780
an-- there we have folks with iPhone
5 , and here we have two more.

108
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,650

109
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:17,037
>> Now, not to be outdone, CS50's own
Cheng Gong also set out this summer

110
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:19,870
to build quite a few things and,
in fact, for reasons that are still

111
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,970
unclear, has been slowly
printing an army of elephants

112
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,250
with articulating arms and trunks.

113
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,515
A couple of which are actually here if
anyone would now like-- an elephant.

114
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:35,650

115
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,522
All right, . but what Cheng also did
for us is he very kindly set up a camera

116
00:05:40,522 --> 00:05:42,230
because that elephant,
believe it or not,

117
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,690
takes some two and a
half hours to print.

118
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,840
Even the iPhone stand took
an hour and a half to print.

119
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,490
And what Cheng went ahead and did
was set up a nice camera in front

120
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,580
of this 3D printer, filmed for an hour
and a half as Ansel's design printed.

121
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,090
We overlaid some sexy
music to it in order

122
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,570
to give you this to look
at how 3D printing works.

123
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,494
And even though this
is actually in plastic,

124
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:05,160
realize that if this is an area
of interest to you academically,

125
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,120
there are folks, among
them Jennifer Lewis here

126
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,036
at the School of
Engineering, who are actually

127
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,920
working on 3D printing
of plastic objects.

128
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,150
But even, increasingly,
biological materials to solve

129
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,530

130
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,944
But here is a little
something from CS50.

131

>> [LOUD MECHANICAL NOISES]

132
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,250
DAVID J. MALAN: It doesn't sound
anything like that in reality,

133
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,240
but it's much cooler to watch it
at that speed, and with that sound.

134
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,000
>> Now, on Wednesday, how
did we first get here?

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,345
We started talking about computer
science and we asked what it was.

136
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:46,470
And it's about a number of things, and
there's so many different directions

137
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,477
in which you can head
after a course like CS50.

138
00:06:48,477 --> 00:06:50,810
In fact, if you picked up one
of those unofficial guides

139
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,080
to CS outside, the booklet that
we've provided, whether you're

140
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,150
thinking of taking just CS50,
or maybe doing a secondary,

141
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,557
or maybe even concentrating
in CS, do flip through that.

142
00:06:59,557 --> 00:07:01,390
And you'll see a diagram
toward the end that

143
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,950
shows you the many different directions
in CS that you can go off in.

144
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,030
>> But for today, we'll focus, again, on
really one of the fundamental views,

145
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,500
perhaps, where you have
inputs to problems,

146
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,430
you have outputs from
problems, and you have

147
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,420
algorithms with which to create
those outputs from those inputs.

148
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,330
And one such example, was of
course, this phone book here.

149
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,180
And we used as an example to go
through an algorithm that was correct.

150
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,490
And then another one was
correct, but a little faster.

151
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,448
And then another one that was a little
more dramatic, but fundamentally

152
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,000
faster.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,720
>> Right, this phone book we
claimed had about 1,000 pages.

154
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,200
And how many times did I have
to tear the phone book in half

155
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,930
to find someone like Mike Smith,
maximally, in 1,000 page book?

156
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,040
So, 10 give or take.

157
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,050
And so once I tore this thing in
half, or simply, more maturely,

158
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,490
divided in half, it's only
10 pages out of 1,000.

159
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,470
And if you extrapolate, a little
unrealistically for a phone book,

160
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,540
but if this phone book had some 4
billion pages in it, so completely

161
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,680
unwieldy physically, how many
times do you divide a 4 billion

162
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,460
page phone book in half?

163
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,035
So it's actually 32, give or take.

164
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:07,090
And so 32 times only, out
of 4 billion pages, can

165
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,700
you find someone like Mike Smith.

166
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,740
And that's efficiency.

167
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,130
That's a good algorithm, daresay.

168
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,480
>> But then we moved from that
to try to formalize it.

169
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,100
And I proposed this pseudocode code.

170
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,800
Pseudocode code is not anything formal.

171
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,880
It's not something you memorize.

172
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,588
It's just something you express
fairly intuitively using English,

173
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:24,990
or any language really, that
conveys your ideas succinctly.

174
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,990
But what's key about
pseudocode code is that you

175
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,331
try to anticipate all of the
possible cases that might happen.

176
00:08:30,331 --> 00:08:33,080
And indeed, in this pseudocode
code, there were really three cases

177
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,700
every time I divided the phone book.

178
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,006
Mike might be to the left.

179
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:37,130
Mike might be to the right.

180
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,240
Or he might be right on the page I'm on.

181
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,110
Or a fourth corner case, so to speak.

182
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,470
A bad scenario might be one
which-- what is happening?

183
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,860
Mike's just not in
the phone book at all.

184
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,720
>> And when programs crash-- when Mac
and PC software that you guys run

185
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,400
on your computers sometimes
hangs or quits unexpectedly,

186
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,770
that generally means that some
programmer, some human like you soon,

187
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,650
just screwed up and made some mistake.

188
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,207
Maybe didn't anticipate that maybe there
is no Mike Smith in the phone book.

189
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:08,040
And if you don't actually write
code to handle situations like that,

190
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,890
generally unpredictable
things can happen.

191
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,960
Your machine can freeze.

192
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,730
It can reboot.

193
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,889
The program can quit.

194
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:14,722
And so all of these
stupidities that you may

195
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:18,030
have encountered in your actual
life just using computers,

196
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,710
will increasingly be just
explained away by this intuition

197
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,920
and this understanding of what is
actually going on underneath the hood.

198
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,329
>> Now let's try to take a look
at a more general problem.

199
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:29,120
Rather than take
attendance in a place like

200
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,230
this, which would be quite slow
to do one, two, three, four.

201
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,070
Or maybe two, four, six, eight.

202
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,080
Let's focus, instead, on
how we might formalize

203
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,400
the algorithm of the process by
which we could take attendance.

204
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,290
And along the way, let's start
to apply some nomenclature

205
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,130
that we'll use today when we actually
start programming in a language.

206
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,910
So I give you now, a four minute video
that we put together with our friends

207
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,820
from TED, the organization.

208
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,380
Whereby we supplied a script and
they brought their animators to bear,

209
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,970
and actually created a 2D
animation of what an algorithm is.

210
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,776
If we could dim the lights.

211
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:06,664
>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

212
00:10:06,664 --> 00:10:17,890

213
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,140
NARRATOR: What's an algorithm?

214
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,620
In computer science,
an algorithm is a set

215
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,840
of instructions resolving
some problem step-by-step.

216
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,310
Typically, algorithms are
executed by computers,

217
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,365
but we humans have algorithms as well.

218
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,240
For instance, how would
you go about counting

219
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,990
the number of people in a room?

220
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,840
Well, if you're like me, you'd probably
point at each person one at a time

221
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,370
and count up from zero.

222
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,200
One, two, three, four, and so forth.

223
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,410
Well, that's an algorithm.

224
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,820
In fact, let's try to express it a
bit more formally in pseudocode code.

225
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,940
English-like syntax that
resembles a programming language.

226
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,880
>> Let n equal 0.

227
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,210
For each person in room,
set n equal to n plus 1.

228
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,790
How to interpret the pseudocode?

229
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,490
Well line one declares,
so to speak, a variable

230
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,880
called n and initializes
its value to 0 This just

231
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,080
means that at the
beginning of our algorithm,

232
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,910
the thing with which we're
counting has a value of 0.

233
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,860
After all, before we start counting
we haven't counted anything yet.

234
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,580
Calling this variable
n is just a convention.

235
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,130
I could have called it most anything.

236
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,460
Now line two demarks
the start of a loop,

237
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,550
a sequence of steps that will
repeat some number of times.

238
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,130
So in our example, the step we're
taking is counting people in the room.

239
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,260
Beneath line two is line
three which describes

240
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,400
exactly how we'll go about counting.

241
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,720
The indentation implies that
it's line three that will repeat.

242
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,190
So with the pseudocode code is
saying is that after starting at 0

243
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,940
for each person in the
room we'll increase n by 1

244
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,310
Now is this algorithm correct?

245
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,820
Well let's bang on it a bit.

246
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,520
>> Does it work if there are
two people in the room?

247
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,420
Let's see.

248
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,500
In line one we initialize n to 0.

249
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,910
For each of these two people,
we then increment n by 1.

250
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,570
So in the first trip through the
loop, we update n from 0 to 1.

251
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,320
On the second trip through that
same loop, we update n from 1 to 2.

252
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,850
And so, by this algorithm's
end, n is 2, which

253
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,950
indeed matches the number
of people in the room.

254
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,040
So far, so good.

255
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,870
>> How about a corner case though?

256
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,090
Suppose that there are 0 people
in the room-- besides me, who's

257
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,420
doing counting.

258
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,380
In line one, we again initialize n to 0.

259
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,810
This time though, line
three doesn't execute at all

260
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,610
since there isn't a person in the room.

261
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:23,540
And so n remains 0, which indeed matches
the number of people in the room.

262
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,670
Pretty simple, right?

263
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,880
But counting people one at a time
is pretty inefficient, too, no?

264
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,160
Surely we can do better.

265
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,440
Why not count two people at a time,
instead of counting one, two, three,

266
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,470
four, five, six, seven,
eight, and so forth.

267
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,106
Why not count two, four,
six, eight, and so on?

268
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:40,670
It even sounds faster.

269
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,940
And it surely is.

270
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,490
>> Let's express this optimization
in pseudocode code.

271
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,040
Let n equal 0.

272
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,760
For each pair of people in
room, set n equal to n plus 2.

273
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,360
Pretty simple change, right?

274
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,560
Rather than count people one at a time,
we instead count them two at a time.

275
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,240
This algorithm's, thus,
twice as fast as the last.

276
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,530
But is it correct?

277
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,160
Let's see.

278
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,580
Does it work if there are
two people in the room?

279
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,800
In line one, we initialize n to 0.

280
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,160
For that one pair of people,
we then increment n by 2.

281
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,910
And so by this algorithm's
end n is 2, which

282
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,910
indeed matches the number
of people in the room.

283
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,610
>> Suppose next that there are
zero people in the room.

284
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,080
In line one we initialize n to 0.

285
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,260
As before, line three
doesn't execute it all

286
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,270
since there aren't any pairs of people
in the room, and so n remains 0.

287
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,840
Which indeed matches the
number of people in the room.

288
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,520
But what if there are
three people in the room?

289
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,380
How does this algorithm fare?

290
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,710
Let's see, in line one,
we initialize n to 0.

291
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,140
For a pair of those people,
we then increment n by 2.

292
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,050
But then what?

293
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,340
There isn't another full
pair of people in the room,

294
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,430
so line two no longer applies.

295
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,790
And so by this algorithm's end,
n is still 2 which isn't correct.

296
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,070
Indeed this algorithm's said to
be buggy because it has a mistake.

297
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,070
>> Let's redress with some
new pseudocode code.

298
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,110
Let n equal 0.

299
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,790
For each pair of people in
room, set N equal to n plus 2.

300
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:05,410
If one person remains unpaired,
set N equal to n plus 1.

301
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,340
To solve this particular problem, we've
introduced in line four a condition,

302
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,120
otherwise known as a
branch, that only executes

303
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,890
if there's one person we
could not pair with another.

304
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,140
And so now, whether
there's one, or three,

305
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,550
or any odd number of people in the room,
this algorithm will now count them.

306
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,810
Can we do even better?

307
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,890
Well, we could count in threes,
or fours, or even fives and tens,

308
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,390
but beyond that, it's going to get
a little bit difficult to point.

309
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,900
>> At the end of the day, whether
executed by computers or humans,

310
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,870
algorithms are just
a set of instructions

311
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,560
with which to solve problems.

312
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,360
These were just three.

313
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,860
What problem would you
solve with an algorithm?

314
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,261
>> DAVID J. MALAN: So deliberately,
a very simple program,

315
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:46,260
a very simple algorithm,
for achieving something

316
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,280
very simple, counting the
number of people in the room.

317
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,370
>> But let's tease apart
some of the representative

318
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,870
features here that are actually
going to be useful even when

319
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,880
implementing the most
complex of software.

320
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,060
So for instance, in this first line,
we have what we call the variable,

321
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,040
and from algebra, you're
generally familiar using x and y

322
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,930
and z sometimes, and so forth.

323
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,770
But in programming, variables
are still, at the end of the day,

324
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,680
very similar to that.

325
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,910
But it's perhaps simpler to think
of a variable as just a container.

326
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,520
And, in fact, it's some number of bits
implemented somehow in your hard disk

327
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,410
or in your computer's memory,
but more on that in the future.

328
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,670
It's just a container.

329
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,310
And if you say something
like let n equal 0,

330
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,310
well that's like calling this glass
bowl here n, just an arbitrary name,

331
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,230
and putting nothing in it initially.

332
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,940
So the value of this
bowl right now is zero.

333
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,380
And of course if you perceive
in a subsequent line,

334
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,070
to actually increment some line of
code, as in this third line here,

335
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,857
by 1, that's like saying what's the
current value of n, it's 0, plus 1,

336
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,690
put something like a
ping pong ball in here.

337
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,140
Now the value of this
variable is quite simply 1.

338
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:50,064
And you could very quickly extrapolate,
but now it's 2, now it's 3, and so on.

339
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:51,230
So that's all a variable is.

340
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,740
It's a piece of storage to
actually store some data.

341
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,050
For now it's a ping pong ball.

342
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:55,883
There it's a number.

343
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:58,910
But it could be words in a
dictionary, like the spell checker

344
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,300
I alluded to on Wednesday for
one of last year's problem sets.

345
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,640
>> Now another key idea, that similarly
is pretty intuitive I would claim,

346
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,690
is that of a loop.

347
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,930
And the loop in the process
of counting everyone

348
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,540
is, of course, doing the same
thing again and again-- either one

349
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,140
at a time or two at a time.

350
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,690
And you can express this in English, or
pseudocode code, in any number of ways,

351
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,560
but using this preposition "for"
is a very common way of doing that.

352
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,460
For each person in the room, do this.

353
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,350
Again and again.

354
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,700
And the fact that it's
indented, line three,

355
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,840
just means that what
you're supposed to do

356
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,490
is the stuff that's indented
below the line two itself.

357
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,590
Just a human convention,
but a common one

358
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,010
as we'll see in actual higher
level programming languages.

359
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,870
>> Now little more interesting is
when you get in a corner case.

360
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,970
For instance, a corner
case was when there

361
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:48,060
were three people, or five, or seven,
or any odd number of people in the room,

362
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,630
because doing that by twos brakes
eventually because your going

363
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,265
to miss someone, either at the
very beginning or the very end

364
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:55,390
depending on how you do it.

365
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,800
And so, now, I have this branch, or
condition, if one person remains,

366
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,490
then go ahead and handle that one
lonesome person who didn't get

367
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,690
paired with someone else.

368
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,030
So that's what we would call
a condition, or a branch.

369
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,500
>> Now pseudocode code
more generally can be

370
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,730
written to solve any number of problems.

371
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,490
And what I thought we'd
do here is take a moment

372
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,089
to invite shall we say CS50's
own Rob Bowden on stage

373
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:25,040
to be joined by two volunteers,
who have no idea what awaits.

374
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,890
A hand went down as soon as I said that.

375
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,700
How about you on the
end here, come on up.

376
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,040
And how about from farther
away, how about way in the back.

377
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,200
Back row, come on up with your hands up.

378
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,475
Alright, and what's your name?

Okay, nice to meet you.

Let me introduce you to Rob Bowden.

383
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,890
This is Anita.

384
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,033
And what is your name?

385
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:44,800
>> KIERSTEN: Kiersten

>> DAVID J. MALAN: Kiersten.

387
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,790
Kiersten, come on up and
meet Rob Bowden and Anita.

388
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,036
Nice to meet you.

389
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,160

390
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,368

00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:54,650
ROB BOWDEN: Nice to meet you.

392
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,566
DAVID J. MALAN: Anita.

393
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:56,520
KIERSTEN: Hi Anita.

394
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,686
DAVID J. MALAN: And your
several hundred classmates.

395
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:02,490
So, now let me go ahead and pull
up just a simple program here

396
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,690
on Mac OS that'll let me
actually jot some notes down.

397
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,570
And if you guys want to each take a
position at one of those schools there,

398
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:16,360
let me go ahead and starts a list
of pseudocode code, if you will.

399
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,970
And what I want to do here,
ultimately is type for you

400
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,470
some instructions that our
audience members are actually

401
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,569
going to recite for us.

402
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,860
Let me go ahead and just
change this to a numbered list

403
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,720
to match what we were doing up there.

404
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,990
And what I'm going to do with
your help, is write a program

405
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,620
in pseudocode, with which
these guys are going

406
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,150
to implement a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich.

407
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,880
So it's perhaps apropos to
show something some of you

408
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,560
might have seen on the internet
for just a brief annoying moment.

409

>> [MUSIC BUCKEWHEAT BOYS, "PEANUT BUTTER
 JELLY TIME"]

410
00:18:47,650 --> 00:19:08,119

411
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:08,910
DAVID J. MALAN: OK.

412
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,050
That's enough of that.

413
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,690
So here meanwhile, I have a
pair of Google Glasses which

414
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,500
we'll put on CS50's own Rob Bowden
to see the world through his eyes.

415
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,140
And we'll do our best in post
production to actually weave

416
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,100
the footage of what Rob is seeing
now, into this actual lecture

417
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,420
video with our two
volunteers beside him.

418
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,480
So what I'm going to do
is, I'll be the typist.

419
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,849
We have the goal here of
actually writing a program

420
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:34,640
with which to make, ultimately, a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich,

421
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,680
but these three are going to behave
as though they are computers.

422
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,638
And computers, at the end of the day,
are actually pretty dumb devices.

423
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:44,432
They're super fast, but they can only
do, literally, what they are told.

424
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:46,890
You can't just say make a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich.

425
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,640
You have to program them to do that.

426
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,420
You have to tell them
with precision what to do,

427
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,400
less things go horribly and,
hopefully, amusingly awry.

one be, if the goal here

430
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,356
is to make a peanut

504
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,220
>> AUDIENCE: Taste peanut
butter to ensure quality.

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:15,960
>> [AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

506
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
DAVID J. MALAN: Step 11.

507
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,500

508
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,340
Step 11.

509
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,101
Step 11.

510
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:22,600
Come on.

511
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,099
Yeah?

512
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:24,208
Right there.

>> AUDIENCE: Carefully pick up jelly.

514
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,220
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Carefully pick up jelly.

515
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,970
OK, and then another hand was up.

516
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,812

517
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:33,520
Right behind you.

518
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,761
Yeah, in blue.

00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:40,671
>> AUDIENCE: All right, remove
lid from [INAUDIBLE], yeah,

520
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:42,635
remove lid from the jelly.

sweep any [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:59,536 --> 00:24:04,456
AUDIENCE: Of course, before [INAUDIBLE],
remove the paper from jelly.

529
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:06,940
DAVID J. MALAN: Remove paper from jelly.

530
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,229
Step 14.

531
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:09,020
We're almost there.

532
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,857
Yes?

>> AUDIENCE: Replace the cap.

538
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,463
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Replace the cap.

540
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,190
Step 16.

541
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:28,931
Yeah?

542
00:24:28,931 --> 00:24:29,806
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

543
00:24:29,806 --> 00:24:34,109

544
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:35,400
DAVID J. MALAN: Say that again.

545
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,100
AUDIENCE: Take cap off of your jelly.

546
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,650
DAVID J. MALAN: Off your jelly.

547
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,720

548
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,510
So really-- Oops.

549
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,420
Come on.

550
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,740
Replace the cap.

551
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,660
Put cap-- You said
remove cap from jelly.

552
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,950
Feel like we're in a bit of a loop.

553
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,640

554
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,398

00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,720
One more step and then
we'll serve sandwiches.

you to our volunteers here.

>> [APPLAUSE}

578
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,940
>> DAVID J. MALAN: We have some nice
parting gifts for each of you.

579
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,350
Your own peanut butter, jelly,
and bread to bring back home.

580
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,774
Thank you.

581
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,118
>> KIERSTEN: Thank you.

582
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,618
DAVID J. MALAN: [INAUDIBLE] welcome.

583
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,849
[APPLAUSE]

584
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:24,390
DAVID J. MALAN: So, this is, of
course, a ridiculous example.

585
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,890
Right?

586
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,890
But it does kind of reveal how we
humans just take clarity for granted.

587
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,890
And the fact I've been
talking to another human,

588
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,300
he or she just knows what you mean.

589
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,220
>> Computers are not going
to know what you mean,

590
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,430
even when using, as
we're about to do today,

591
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:42,300
programming something in Scratch, a drag
and drop, puzzle piece style language.

592
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,310
Even designed for young
children, you have

593
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,726
to be so explicit and so literal with
what you want your program to do.

594
00:26:48,726 --> 00:26:50,600
Now ultimately, we're
going to be programming

595
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,550
not in pseudocode code,
English like syntax,

596
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,370
but code or, more properly, source code.

597
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:59,260
Source code is just the fancy way
for describing code you actually

598
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,730
write with a keyboard that's
not in English per se.

599
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:06,480
It's in C or Java or C++ or something
like that, as we'll soon see.

600
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,510
>> And in fact, just to scare a
few of you, at first glance,

601
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:13,769
this is a program written in a language
called C. But to un-scare a few of you,

602
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:15,560
you will completely
understand what's going

603
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,980
on come next Monday when it
comes to something like this.

604
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,510
Frankly, this is an older language.

605
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,430
It's fairly arcane,
but it's representative

606
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:26,120
of a lot of languages these days that
have lots of parentheses and curly

607
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,630
braces and quote marks and semicolons.

608
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,780
And a lot of this
syntactic stuff that is not

609
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,450
at all intellectually interesting.

610
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,790
Indeed, it's an utter distraction
from the very simple ideas

611
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,370
that are staring us in the face.

612
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:41,760
This program, as you might just guess,
prints to someone's computer screen

613
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,070
the words "Hello comma world."

614
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,860
That's it.

615
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,580
So clearly, there's
a lot of stuff that's

616
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,970
getting in the way of
some obviousness there,

617
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,490
but it's going to very quickly slip
away and be completely intuitive.

618
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,617
>> Indeed, what we're going to do
today is distill this fairly complex

619
00:27:55,617 --> 00:27:58,950
looking program, which again you'll come
to understand quickly, but to something

620
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,710
much simpler.

621
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,640
Let's just say what we mean.

622
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,590
Let's draw a picture of what we mean,
by way of these puzzle pieces here.

623
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,110
>> So this is a programming
language known as Scratch.

624
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,080
It was developed by MIT's Media Lab.

625
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,830
And what you'll see in problem set zero,
which will be released later tonight,

626
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,980
we'll have you go to this
URL here scratch.mit.edu.

627
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,940
And they have a web
based interface via which

628
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,540
you will write your first program.

629
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,330
Or those of you with prior
experience, your second programs,

630
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,090
but in an environment that's
probably a little unfamiliar and that

631
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,930
will push you to create something
using this very visual environment.

632
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,940
>> Now, what I'm going to do here
is open up the program itself.

633
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:41,911
It exists not only as a web browser,
but also as a downloadable program

634
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:44,660
so that you can actually use it
if you don't have internet access.

635
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,743
And I'm going to do that
in here, in Sanders, just

636
00:28:46,743 --> 00:28:49,580
in case the Wi-Fi doesn't
cooperate super well.

637
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,640
And what I'm going to do is point
out a few features of this program.

638
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,720
So, to be clear, I have just double
clicked the icon on my desktop,

639
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,830
or equivalently gone to scratch.mit.edu,
and it's pulled up this window.

640
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,650
This is a programming environment.

641
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,110
It's a piece of software that
some of our friends at MIT

642
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:08,850
wrote that let's us and you write
programs in a language called Scratch.

643
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:12,010
>> Now this happens to be a
cat who's also named Scratch

644
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,890
and this is his world in which he lives.

645
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:17,175
This is the stage, so to speak, that
rectangle on the top left hand corner.

646
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:18,800
And he doesn't have to look like a cat.

647
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,591
You can make him look
like anything and you

648
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:23,700
can have many such sprites,
or characters, in a program.

649
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,450
Meanwhile, over here on the far
right, is a big blank slate.

650
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,260
And this is where, in a moment,
we are going to start programming

651
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,750
by dragging and dropping
these graphical puzzle

652
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,300
pieces that are right
here in the middle.

653
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,140
And there's way more of them than
we'll spend time on here in class

654
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,080
because you'll find that
they're all fairly intuitive.

655
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,788
Again, it's designed
for children, but we

656
00:29:41,788 --> 00:29:45,759
use it to tease apart some of those
fundamental ideas of variables, loops,

657
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,050
conditions, and, soon, things
like functions and events

658
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,810
and threads and other fancy things we'll
get to before long to actually create

659
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,840
something from Scratch.

660
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,810
Pun intended.

661
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:58,740
>> Now, what I'm going to do here is
click on not motion, but control.

662
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,400
And this is just a
categorization of here--

663
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,150
and I see a different
color set of blocks.

664
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,030
But notice a few familiar words.

665
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,830
"If" and "else if" and "repeat."

666
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,440
And you can probably guess
that's reminiscent of the branch,

667
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,870
or the conditions we saw, and
even the looping construct.

668
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,760
So we have similar blocks here.

669
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,720
But the most interesting
one is this one here.

670
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,690
When this green flag is clicked,
this, for those with prior programing

671
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,110
experience, is equivalent
to a main function.

672
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,300
But for those unfamiliar,
this is the puzzle piece

673
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,320
that will kick start our entire program.

674
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,350
It literally means when I go, in this
program, and click a green flag--

675
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:35,560
which you can see up here in the
top left hand corner of the UI,

676
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,570
so see the green flag
next to the red stop sign?

677
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,475
When I click that, my
program is going to run.

678
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:43,850
Now, I'm going to do something
super simple with Scratch.

679
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,640
I'm going to go ahead
and go to the looks panel

680
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,010
here, where I have a bunch
of purple puzzle pieces,

681
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,887
and I'm going to go ahead and do
something super simple like, say.

682
00:30:53,887 --> 00:30:55,720
And then-- notice this
text in the white box

683
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,290
is editable-- I'm going to say
"Hello world," just like we

684
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,470
did in that textual
version a moment ago.

685
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:05,920
And now if I go and click this
green flag, I have now programmed.

686
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,810
It's not a particularly
interesting program,

687
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,760
but I made the computer do something.

688
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,120
I started a program and it
did what I told it to do.

689
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,170
Now, I can continue to drag and drop
more and more of these puzzle pieces

690
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,220
and they're going to interlock, but
let's slap some terminology on here

691
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,680
that we'll see recurring
throughout the course,

692
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,610
and really throughout computer science
and programming more generally.

693
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,990
>> This "say" block, in purple, let's
just start calling a statement.

694
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,240
It's like a statement of fact.

695
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,380
Do this.

696
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,590
So, it's a category of
instructions that you

697
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,760
might feed a computer as part
of a program or an algorithm.

698
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,270
And to be clear, you've
probably taken for granted

699
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,930
that you have programs on your computer.

700
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,850
And they're kind of algorithms, but a
program is really a bunch of algorithms

701
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,160
that some humans wrote.

702
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,040
They packaged it up and
they sold it so you,

703
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,330
or they posted on a website
for you to download.

704
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,930
So, a program is just a
whole bunch of zeros and ones

705
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,970
that, somehow, humans created.

706
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:00,080
And those patterns of zeros and
ones represent things, ultimately,

707
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,030
like "say hello world" or "play
this music" or "play this video"

708
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,129
or "send an email."

709
00:32:05,129 --> 00:32:06,920
But we'll come back in
way more detail what

710
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,780
a program is when you,
yourself, write them.

711
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,320
>> Here's another statement--
"Wait for one second."

712
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,330
I didn't use this yet, but if I want
my program to pause for a moment

713
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,540
to do something, I can tell it to do so.

714
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,450
Wait one second.

715
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,150
Now another one might be "play sound."

716
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:23,270
So, this is unique to Scratch, it
has the ability to play sounds.

717
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,130
So, a statement I might
use is, here, "play sound."

718
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,530
Meanwhile, Boolean expression,
so this is a fancier word

719
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:34,490
named after just a guy named Mr. Bool,
and this is all about a question.

720
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,470
True or false-- is the mouse down?

721
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:41,100
A Boolean expression is just
some expression in English

722
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,860
that is either true or false.

723
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,140
Either on or off.

724
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,130
Either one or zero.

725
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,960
You can think of it
in any number of ways,

726
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,220
but it's either true or
this false, ultimately.

727
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,540
So "mouse down question mark,"
that would be a Boolean expression.

728
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,300
And you can think of others, perhaps.

729
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,510
For instance, "is the left number
less than the right number?"

730
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,410
That, too, would be
a Boolean expression.

731
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,540
"Less than" is a Boolean expression.

732
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,280
>> This one, too, "touching mouse pointer."

733
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,196
I'm not sure why they
called it mouse pointer.

734
00:33:05,196 --> 00:33:08,430
It just means, is the cursor, is the
arrow on the screen, touching the cat,

735
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,022
for instance.

736
00:33:09,022 --> 00:33:10,480
Or some other aspect of the screen.

737
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,710
And it's a question, again, and
that denotes a Boolean expression.

738
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,130
Something that you might
want to use in a condition.

739
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,100
So we'll come to that in just a moment.

740
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,350
You can "and" things together.

741
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:23,099
So, if you want to check if this
is the case AND that is the case,

742
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:25,580
you can use an "and" block like this.

743
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,850
And here's that condition.

744
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:31,290
Notice the shape of the little opening
in the top of this yellow puzzle piece,

745
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,480
it's reminiscent of the shape
that we just saw a moment ago.

746
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,920
Each of these Boolean expressions
have these pointed edges

747
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,030
on the left and right.

748
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:43,140
And that's because MIT folks decided
that by visually conveying shapes,

749
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,780
you can kind of help people,
students and children alike,

750
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,650
to kind of fill in the blanks literally.

751
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,780
>> Now that puzzle-- that
opening is a little small,

752
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,750
and as we'll see in the program,
in Scratch, it will grow to fit.

753
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,830
It will maintain its shape, ultimately.

754
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:58,350
So a condition let's you decide
"should I do something or not?"

755
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,470
A Boolean expression
is the actual question

756
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,100
you're using to decide do I go to
the left OR do I go to the right

757
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,710
when I encounter this
so-called fork in the road?

758
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,980
You can have two branches.

759
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,909
IF something is true, do
this, else go that way,

760
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:14,590
or you can just do nothing at
all, as this block implied.

761
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,360
Similarly, we can nest these things.

762
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,204
So if you want to triple fork in the
road, either do this or this or that,

763
00:34:20,204 --> 00:34:21,870
you can just nest these things together.

764
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,520
And it starts to get a little
ugly, eventually, for sure,

765
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,120
but the logic is still the same.

766
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,000
You can literally read
this top to bottom

767
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,290
and it says what it means-- if this
is true, do this, else if else.

768
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:36,179
>> A loop doesn't get simpler in Scratch.

769
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,422
Forever do the following.

770
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:39,880
Now you might not think you
can do much because there's not

771
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,839
much space between the top and the
bottom of this puzzle piece opening.

772
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,671
But you'll see Scratch is going to
grow to fit as many puzzle pieces

773
00:34:45,671 --> 00:34:47,060
as you want to cram in there.

774
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,960
Another loop might be
expressed with repeats.

775
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,590
If you know in advance, "I
want to do something 10 times,"

776
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,010
you can just tell Scratch
to do something 10 times.

777
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,260
And, meanwhile, we can have variables.

778
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,572
So here's an arbitrary one,
it's orange in this case,

779
00:34:59,572 --> 00:35:00,780
and this is a whirlwind tour.

780
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,540
Again, you'll find this very accessible
once you start pointing and clicking.

781
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,930
I've named my variable n, but I
could have named it anything I want,

782
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,280
and I'm setting it here, in
this arbitrary example, to zero.

783
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,250
>> Now seeing a program like hello
world is not all that compelling,

784
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:17,900
so let's actually open up something
that a former student made.

785
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:23,100
Let me go ahead and open up,
for instance, this one here,

786
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,780
for which I would love
to have a volunteer.

787
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,450
All right, how about-- let's go farther.

788
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,240
Yes, come on up.

789
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,056
What's your name?

790
00:35:30,056 --> 00:35:30,635
>> ABBY: Abby.

791
00:35:30,635 --> 00:35:32,010
DAVID J. MALAN: Abby, come on up.

792
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,930
So have you ever played
this game before?

793
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:36,430
ABBY: No.

794
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,370
DAVID J. MALAN: All right.

795
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,380
David, nice to meet you.

796
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,620
Come on over.

797
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,300
And what is your programming
background, if any.

798
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,914
>> ABBY: I've learned some C++.

799
00:35:43,914 --> 00:35:45,580
DAVID J. MALAN: You've learned some C++.

800
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,382
And what is your game
playing background?

801
00:35:48,382 --> 00:35:49,505
>> ABBY: Not a lot.

802
00:35:49,505 --> 00:35:51,130
DAVID J. MALAN: OK, so we'll take that.

803
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,700
So here's how the game is going to work.

804
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,510
I'm going to go ahead and
click the green flag, which

805
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,830
is up here at the top right.

806
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,710
Now your predecessor in the class
has given you some instructions here.

807
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,306
And in just a moment, it
says "space to begin."

808
00:36:02,306 --> 00:36:03,680
So go ahead and hit the spacebar.

809
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,507
>> COMPUTER GAME: Pikachu.

810
00:36:05,507 --> 00:36:08,340
DAVID J. MALAN: And the goal is to
catch the food, as depicted there

811
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,320
on the left.

812
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,388
And to [INAUDIBLE]

813
00:36:11,388 --> 00:36:15,356
>> [GAME MUSIC PLAYING]

814
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:27,280

815
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,610
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Aww, well,
thank you for playing.

816
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,800
We have here a little
parting gift for you.

817
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,574
We have CS50 stress ball,
if you'd like to choose.

818
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:36,820
All right, good to meet you.

819
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,680
Thank you for coming and challenging.

820
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,410

821
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:46,910
So we have more stress balls, so
let's do one more example to motivate.

822
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,150
A volunteer?

823
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,510
All right, how about
right here in front.

824
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,250
What's your name?

825
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:51,660
>> PHILLIP: Phillip.

826
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,660
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Phillip.

827
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,530
Come on up, Phillip.

828
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,340
So, Phillip is going to be
challenged with another game

829
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,840
that one of your predecessors
wrote as part of problem set zero,

830
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,510
called Ivy's Hardest Game.

831
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,980
And we'll see in just a
moment what's meant by this.

832
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,400
Phillip, nice to meet you.

833
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,060
What is your background?

834
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,310
PHILLIP: Done a lot of coding.

835
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,110
Done a little gaming, too.

836
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:11,570
>> DAVID J. MALAN: OK.

837
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,620
Got a lot of gaming, too.

838
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,230
And have you played this game before?

839

post that online later so

859
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,820
that you can procrastinate
with it as well.

860
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,550
Princeton comes up next, after that.

861
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:35,470
>> So now let's actually proceed
to start from scratch,

862
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:39,310
so to speak, and actually build up until
we can tease apart some of these ideas

863
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,970
and get to something even
more complex by the end.

864
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,240
I'm going to go over here and I'm going
to go ahead and create a new file.

865
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,460
So again, the problem set will walk
you through some of these steps.

866
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,300
But, all I did was go
to the File menu and I

867
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,760
said "new," so much like Microsoft
Word, or any program like that.

868
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,630
>> And let's go ahead now-- and we
implemented "Hello world" a moment ago,

869
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,410
but let's do something a little cuter.

870
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,150
I'm going to go up to events.

871
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,350
And I'm going to do "when
green flag clicked."

872
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,830
And then I'm going to use,
shall we say, a branch.

873
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,610
So I'm going to use an "if" condition.

874
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,940
And notice how as soon as I get close
to it, it wants to snap together.

875
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,020
So I let go and it snaps together.

876
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,150
And now I can do something interesting.

877
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:19,150
If I scroll through here, I'm going
to see a whole bunch of blocks.

878
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,620
If I go to "data"-- let me zoom in--
there is something about variables.

879
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,160
If I go to "motion," you can
apparently turn things around.

880
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,760
If I go to "operators"--
oh, this is interesting,

881
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,000
I can pick a random number.

882
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,119
So let me do something with only
some probability, just because.

883
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:36,160
I'm going to go ahead and
drag this puzzle piece,

884
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,910
this is that less than
block, so it's just

885
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,480
"is this number less than that one?"

886
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,438
But I don't want a hard code a number
because that be pretty pointless.

887
00:40:42,438 --> 00:40:46,270
So I'm going to drag this piece
here, and notice how it snaps in,

888
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,480
and now let me go ahead and say "if
the number that's picked randomly

889
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,820
is less than six, do the following."

890
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,790
Now why less than six?

891
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:56,400
What probability is this effectively
going to give me, just intuitively?

892
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,440
About 50%, right?

893
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,190
If the number that's guess randomly
between 1 and 10 is less than six,

894
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,480
clearly it's one, two,
three, four, or five.

895
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,740
And so that's going to give me a
50% probability of what happening?

896
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,890
>> Well let's do something like
this, "play sound meow."

897
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,750
And notice, again,
the puzzle piece grows

898
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,700
to fit, so long as the shapes match.

899
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,910
That's what's important.

900
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:18,000
Let me go over to Scratch
here and click "play."

901
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,300
Nothing happens.

902
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,160
Is that a bug?

903
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:21,999
No, not necessary.

904
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:24,040
It could just be that a
bigger number was chosen.

905
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,762
So let's do it again.

906
00:41:25,762 --> 00:41:27,550
Nothing.

>> [MEOWING]

913
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:35,380
DAVID J. MALAN: So if you've
ever played a game, of course,

914
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,500
where stuff is happening randomly,
like the bad guys are coming or not

915
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,350
coming on to the screen, or
things are falling or not falling,

916
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,610
that's just because something super
simple like this is happening.

917
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,010
Pick a random number, and if
it's less than some value,

918
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:49,100
maybe do this or maybe do that.

919
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,340
We can incorporate
that into a condition.

920
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,600
Let's do something different.

921
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,559
>> Let me throw that away.

922
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:56,058
You can get rid of stuff by
just dragging it off to the left

923
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:56,810
and letting go.

924
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:00,310
Let me go ahead and do a forever block
and very quickly do something annoying.

925
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,010
Let me go ahead and
say "play sound meow."

926
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:06,620
But I don't want this to be too
annoying, so let me grab this block,

927
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,090
"wait one second," and notice
there's no more room for it.

928
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,310
But if you go close enough,
it wants to go there.

929
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,100
So I let go and it will
grow to fill the block.

930
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,932
So now, this is a loop.

931

932
00:42:16,432 --> 00:42:18,473
DAVID J. MALAN: I'm
literally doing this forever.

933
00:42:18,473 --> 00:42:19,360
Again and again.

934
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,510
That is just not natural sounding.

935
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,800
Let me go ahead and change this
to not one second, to two seconds

936
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,854
and hit Enter.

937
00:42:25,854 --> 00:42:28,770
And what's nice about Scratch is
that you could program interactively.

938
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:32,450
Make a change, maybe hit Enter or Play
again, and it will just keep going.

939
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,962
Well, now why don't we do
something a little cuter?

940
00:42:34,962 --> 00:42:39,680
Rather than do everything from scratch,
let me go ahead and open up an advance

941
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,180
made one, that I pre-baked,
called "Pet the Cat."

942
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,920
And we'll post all of
these files online,

943
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,464
and problem set zero will tell you
how to access them and open them up.

944
00:42:48,464 --> 00:42:49,880
And notice, this is pretty simple.

945
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,860
But in advance, I seem to have grabbed
a "forever" block, so I've got a loop.

946
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,500
And then I've got an "if" condition.

947
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,410
I've got a Boolean expression.

948
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,100
>> So in English, just glancing at
this, especially if you've never

949
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:04,278

951
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:09,960
>> DAVID J. MALAN: If you pet the cat,
the cat is going to meow, right?

952
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,560
Because "forever unchecking" is
the mouse pointer touching the cat.

953
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,630
So to be clear, and I didn't say
this before, all of these puzzle

954
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,750
pieces and the script that
we have combined them into,

955
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:25,510
so to speak, a script is synonymous with
program, really, belongs to this cat.

956
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:30,110
And the reason is-- because notice
how this same cat here is highlighted,

957
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,710
down here you can create a
second cat or dog or really

958
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,970
anything you want graphically.

959
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:35,900
You can import something
from Photoshop, or the like,

960
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,300
and integrate something if you
want to make it for a project.

961
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,174
And what you'll find,
ultimately, is that you

962
00:43:40,174 --> 00:43:44,800
can add scripts, add puzzle
pieces, to individual characters.

963
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,210
So these all belong to
this particular cat.

964
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:51,770
So now if I go ahead and play
this program, nothing's happening.

965
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:52,970
But it is running.

966
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:56,364
The program is in this forever loop,
kind of waiting for what to happen?

into great detail with all of these,

990
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,150
but notice there is a
couple of new features here.

991
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:55,540
There's a variable, called "muted,"
and then there's a bunch of conditions.

992
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,900
And for now, let me
just tease you by saying

993
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:03,170
that if this guy gets too annoying,
I can hit the spacebar and he stops.

994
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,880
Because the role being played by
these two scripts is as follows.

995
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,510
One of them is doing the
barking every few seconds.

996
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:11,305
The other one is just waiting
for me to hit the spacebar.

997
00:45:11,305 --> 00:45:14,780
And if I do hit the spacebar,
it's going to change

998
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,096
the state of this variable, the value
of this variable, that's apparently

999
00:45:18,096 --> 00:45:20,470
called "muted," I didn't call
it something boring like n,

1000

And so you can actually
see now, that you

1004
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,720
could have two scripts, two
programs running simultaneously,

1005
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,360
and both of them might be sitting
in a loop doing something.

1006
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:38,067
Waiting for the human to do
something like hitting spacebar.

DAVID J. MALAN: And now
he's on his way again.

1009
00:45:40,566 --> 00:45:41,640
[SEAL BARKING]

1010
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,220
DAVID J. MALAN: So what else
might we do with these examples?

1011
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:50,920
Well, let's go ahead and do an
example with counting sheep.

1012
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:59,210
We'll continue this along the lines here
of-- let's open up the sheep example.

1013
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,460
And notice, much like before, this one,
thankfully, is a little less annoying.

1014
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,940
Once I hit play here--
Oh no, this is annoying.

1015
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,130
He is going to baa
with some probability.

1016
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:11,050
Let's play this again.

1017
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:15,221
>> [SHEEP BLEETING]

1018
00:46:15,221 --> 00:46:18,470
DAVID J. MALAN: The only difference is
we've changed the costume, so to speak,

1019
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:21,710
and we're halving and say
what that actual number is.

1020
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:24,680
Well let's go ahead and
take this one step further.

1021
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,190
And let me tease you with
one other feature here.

1022
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,800
Let's go ahead and open up
a program called Threads.

1023
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,620
So much like you can have one
sprite, having multiple scripts,

1024
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:41,250
you can have two sprites, a bird in
a cat, each having their own script.

1025
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,976
And each of them can
operate simultaneously.

1026
00:46:43,976 --> 00:46:45,980
If you've ever heard the
word "multithreading"

1027
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:49,240
a computer is "multithreaded" means
it can do multiple things at once,

1028
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,880
and, indeed, so can Scratch.

1029
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,690
>> And now notice the bird is kind of dumb.

1030
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:55,100
It's just doing things randomly,
bouncing off the screen.

1031
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:59,460
Clearly the cat has been programmed
to kind of have seeking capabilities

1032
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:02,680
to home in on the bird because
he's always pointing at him.

1033
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,176
Until finally, he
catches the actual bird.

1034
00:47:06,176 --> 00:47:08,550
So I won't dwell on the details
here, but you can kind of

1035
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:12,160
glimpse the same shapes, some
"if" conditions, some variables,

1036
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,740
maybe some loops, are
ultimately doing the same thing.

1037
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,400
>> Now let me go ahead and open
up something else altogether,

1038
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,920
to tease some of you, particularly
those more comfortable,

1039
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,760
what you can actually do with this.

1040
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,080
I'm going to go ahead
and open up Button here.

1041
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,740
And this is a super
simple-seeming program,

1042
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:34,190
but watch what happens
when I-- Watch what

1043
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:39,860
happens when I open this version of it,
here in the browser, scratch.mit.edu.

1044
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:43,460
And when I click this big red
button, notice what happens.

1045
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,110

1046
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:47,647
So what's going on here?

1047
00:47:47,647 --> 00:47:50,480
There's actually a lot more complexity
going on underneath the hood,

1048
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,896
even though I've implemented
this, or frankly, Dan Bradley

1049
00:47:52,896 --> 00:47:54,660
has implemented this so simply.

1050
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:59,540
He has designed a custom Scratch puzzle
piece, known as a Scratch extension,

1051
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,300
he called it Toggle.

1052
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:06,332
>> And what Toggle does is it sends
a message over the internet.

1053
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:08,290
And that message itself
looks a little cryptic.

1054
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:10,248
But this, too, you'll
understand by term's end.

1055
00:48:10,248 --> 00:48:14,930
The message he's actually sending
looks a little something like this.

1056
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:15,921
It's just text.

1057
00:48:15,921 --> 00:48:16,420
Cryptic.

1058
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,130
You'll understand it by the time
we get the problem set seven.

1059
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:22,180
It's just sending a textual message
over the internet to a server.

1060
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,330
And that server is, ultimately,
talking to this light bulb, which

1061
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:27,240
has one of those fancy light bulbs
in it that, itself, is talking

1062
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,760
to the Wi-Fi in the network here,
where a local device down here--

1063
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,400
and, ultimately, it's actually
turning that light on and off.

1064
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,240
But we can do more
interesting things still.

1065
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,270
Notice what Dan also did for us.

1066
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:42,210
He made multiple sprites, each of
which has a script waiting for a click.

1067
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,030
And if I click red, it goes red.

1068
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,780
If I get blue, it goes blueish.

1069
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,854
Green, yellow, orange.

1070
00:48:49,854 --> 00:48:52,520
And all of this is happening by
going way out onto the internet,

1071
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,690
back down here to the
light bulb, on and off.

1072
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:57,981
>> And if you can believe it-- and this is
perhaps one of the most complex Scratch

1073
00:48:57,981 --> 00:49:00,930
projects someone has implemented--
he did it, in fairness, in a day.

1074
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:04,180
And that was the challenge we threw down
to Dan when we saw have binary bulbs,

1075
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,810
we have Scratch, how
can we combine them?

1076
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,410
And, indeed, this is absolutely
something anyone in this room

1077
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:14,250
could do by semester's end-- Is he
reimplemented binary bulbs using

1078
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:18,310
the same interface that was
on our iPad on Wednesday.

1079
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:22,000
So that now, if I actually
click the plus over here,

1080
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,250
we have one, two, three.

1081
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,550
I can hit the 16 and turn that one on.

1082
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,440
128, and so forth.

1083
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,250
>> Now if that alone has
and blown your mind,

1084
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:35,680
you could do things far more accessible,
not involving any hardware certainly.

1085
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,320
Just things on the screen itself.

1086
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,110
And, indeed, what most students
end up doing is some kind of game,

1087
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:44,600
some piece of artistic work, or
some kind of interactive animation.

1088
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,352
And I will say one of our
favorites has been this one.

1089
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:49,060
And I thought if we
could dim the lights,

1090
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:52,960
we'll take a glimpse at this final
Scratch project in conclusion.

1091
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,460
But what you'll should keep in mind, as
I can tease you with one last detail,

1092
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,140

1095
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,430
And you will be greeted
in problem set zero

1096

guides most of our walkthroughs.

These are embedded videos
in the problem sets

1098
00:50:11,952 --> 00:50:15,160
that will hold your hand through a lot
of the initial set up and through many

1099
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,570
of the possible design decisions.

1100

when picking up a homework assignment

1101
