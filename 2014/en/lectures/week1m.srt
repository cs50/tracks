1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,952

2
00:00:11,952 --> 00:00:13,800
>> DAVID J. MALAN: So this is CS50.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,970
And this was CS50's own Colton Ogden,
for more of who's music you can

4
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,820
download at soundcloud.com/cs50.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,690
>> So today we focus all the more
on the art of programming.

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,980
And we take where we left
off last week, focusing

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,660
on Scratch, which was this
graphical programming language.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,490
And take things down to a lower level,
using a more traditional programming

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,420
language known as C. But
along the way, realizing

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,730
that the same ideas we
talked about last Friday

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,390
will recur not only in this
language C, but in most every other

12
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,350
that we look at this semester.

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,247
>> So we called this thing
here what last time?

14
00:00:50,247 --> 00:00:51,830
This is representative of a statement.

15
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,080
So we called this a statement.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,100
And it does something.

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,910
It's an instruction that a
computer or Scratch might execute.

18
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,910
And henceforth, let's also start
calling something like this a function,

19
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,070
for reasons we shall soon see.

20
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,681
>> Meanwhile, we saw things like this.

21
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:05,680
And these are generally
known as what construct?

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,240
>> AUDIENCE: Loop.

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,860
>> DAVID J. MALAN: So a loop.

24
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,943
So pretty straightforward.

25
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,470
It literally does what it says.

26
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,210
And in Scratch, if you want to
cram more puzzle pieces in there,

27
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,950
the piece will grow to fit it.

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,790
And we'll see in C that
we can do the same thing.

29
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,000
>> Another type of loop, though,
in Scratch might be forever,

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,820
or there's any number
of other approaches.

31
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,150
But let's take a more
generalist look, with a face

32
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,402
that's likely quite familiar,
at loops more generally.

33
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:29,110
MARK ZUCKERBERG: One
thing that computers

34
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,860
are really good at is
repeating commands.

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,910
As a person, you'd get
really bored if you

36
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,730
had to do the same thing
lots of times in a row.

37
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,530
But a computer can do the same thing
millions or even billions of times,

38
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,290
and not get bored, and be able
to carry that out really well.

39
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,650
>> So for example, if I
wanted to wish everyone

40
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,840
on Facebook a happy birthday
by sending them an email,

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,550
it might take me more than a
century to actually write out

42
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,000
all of those emails to everyone.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,780
But with just a few lines of code, I can
have a system send an email to everyone

44
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,930
on Facebook wishing
them a happy birthday.

45
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,730
So that's what loops are and why
they're valuable and something

46
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,740
that computers can do very well.

47
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,630
>> DAVID J. MALAN: So if
you've been the recipient

48
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,820
of some of CS50's and
Dropbox's space of late,

49
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,590
that's actually precisely what we
do, using code quite like that.

50
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,600
We essentially have a big
spreadsheet into which

51
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,016
folks have been inputting their
names and email addresses.

52
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:18,160
And we wrote a tiny bit of code that
can iterate over those addresses

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,860
and spit out unique addresses in
case anyone submitted multiple times.

54
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,120
And thereafter, we send an
automated email from CS50's bot,

55
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,190
including the coupon code.

56
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,290
>> Now we also looked at
this construct last time.

57
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,100
And this is a particular
example of what?

58
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,050
So, yeah, a Boolean expression.

59
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,050
And the shape is meant
to capture that as well.

60
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,966
All such questions of the
form true or false in Scratch

61
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:41,590
will look a little something like this.

62
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,200
And we call this a Boolean expression.

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,170
That's indeed true or false, yes or no.

64
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,150
It's a way of answering a question.

65
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,420
>> And Meanwhile you can use these Boolean
expressions inside of constructs

66
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,720
like these, which of
course are conditions

67
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,259
or branches, proverbial
forks in the road.

68
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:59,550
And they can look not only
like this, but they can also

69
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,080
have elses associated with them.

70
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,820
And you can actually have a three way
fork in the road or a four way fork

71
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,340
in the road, simply by
nesting these things,

72
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,510
as you'll see in Scratch
if you haven't already.

73
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,550
And as you can do in C as well.

74
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,810
>> Let's take another generalist
look at an alumnist, as well, who

75
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,490
might present a different approach
to these things called conditions.

76
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,060
>> BILL GATES: People make
decisions every day.

77
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,530
For example, before you go outside you
kind of have an if statement that says,

78
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,480
if it's raining then I
need to get my jacket.

79
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,820
And computers are amazing once you
decide those kinds of statements,

80
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:42,280
that they can reliably execute
those things at unbelievable speed.

81
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,240
And so a computer program really
is a little bit of math and some

82
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,050
if statements where
the decision gets made.

83
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,020
>> DAVID J. MALAN: So as
you may know, it was

84
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,880
folks like Bill Gates,
Paul Allen, and others

85
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,240
that truly kicked off the
so-called personal computer

86
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,990
revolution some years ago.

87
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,140
I thought, before we dive
into some administrivia,

88
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,920
we'd relate a tale from the Albuquerque,
New Mexico museum of Natural History

89
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,650
and science where some of Bill Gates'
and Paul Allen's earliest stories

90
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,470
are recounted how we have now
today's PCs and Macs and more.

91
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,390
For this, though, we need two volunteers
who have very good narration voices

92
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,735
to read a script aloud.

93
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:25,530
>> All right, how about in back there.

94
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,120
Come on up.

95
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,770
And how about in front here.

96
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,340
Come on down.

97
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,600
Take your places here.

98
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,444
As you guys come up, a couple
of administrative announcements.

99
00:04:32,444 --> 00:04:34,360
sectioning, the process
of choosing a section,

100
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,068
will start this
Wednesday through Friday.

101
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,400
More on that this coming
Wednesday in lecture.

102
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,770
>> Super sections, meanwhile, are
something that we offer next week

103
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,310
whereby the entire class is invited
to participate in fairly large scale

104
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,690
sections, one more comfy,
one less comfortable.

105
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,340
And we will announce the particulars
of that, as well, later this week.

106
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,310
>> Meanwhile sections,
themselves, will start

107
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,241
in week three of the course, zero index,
which means those are a couple of weeks

108
00:04:57,241 --> 00:04:57,740
out.

109
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,450
So not to worry.

110
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,014
You have not yet missed
anything along those lines.

111
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:03,930
Meanwhile in the meantime, if you
have any questions administratively,

112
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,120
email myself and Devon and Gabe
and Rob at this address here.

113
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,320
>> Lastly, problem set
0 is, of course, out.

114
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,320
You may have noticed it
on the course's website.

115
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,840
It should provide you with
all answers to questions

116
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,250
you might have along the way for
getting started with the problem set.

117
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,430
But if you find yourself
in need of a helping hand,

118
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,020
by all means attend office hours,
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

119
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,290
of this week in the evening
in four dining halls.

120
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,650
See that URL there for the particulars
of where office hours shall be.

121
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,000
>> Now Let's meet our
two guests here today.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,740
What's your name?

123
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,290
>> JAY PAUL: Jay Paul.

124
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,880
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Jay
Paul, nice to meet you.

125
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,330
>> HIKARI: Hikari.

126
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:37,975
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Hikari?

127
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:38,250
>> HIKARI: Hikari.

128
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:38,810
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Hikari.

129
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,790
Nice to meet you as well.

130
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,123
Jay Paul and Hikari have in
front of them on these music

131
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:45,100
stands two scripts that I printed
out this morning from the New Mexico

132
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,692
museum of Natural History and Science.

133
00:05:46,692 --> 00:05:48,400
And what I thought
I'd do on the overhead

134
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,830
is accompany your recitation
of the script and this history

135
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,700
with some visual images, no surprises.

136
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,512
>> And what I've done in advance
is prehighlight on your script

137
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:59,470
what you should read,
and what you should read.

138
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,920
And we'll essentially
just alternate paragraphs.

139
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,211
So it's much like you might
have done in English class.

140
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:06,875
That's really compel the audience
to believe in your tale here.

141
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:07,600
Shall we?

142
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,272
So the story here is, we have a
BASIC, and it begins in Cambridge.

143
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:18,750
>> JAY PAUL: It was winter, 1974,
in Cambridge, Massachusetts

144
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,240
where winters can be cold.

145
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,800
A bearded, long haired
college dropout named

146
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,280
Paul Allen was drudging across Harvard
Square, absorbed in his thoughts.

147
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,050
His main preoccupation in those days
was how to get his friend, Bill Gates,

148
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,974
to quit school and go
into business with him.

149
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:37,890
HIKARI: The two had already gone
through a number of business ventures

150
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,850
together, beginning at Lakeside
school in Seattle where

151
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:45,220
they were paid in free computer time to
test a PDP-10 computer at a local time

152
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,580
sharing company.

153
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,930
The most recent plan had been to quit
school and form a software company.

154
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,440
Allen had left Washington
State University.

155
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,380
But at the last minute, Gates
decided to stick with Harvard.

156
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,080
>> JAY PAUL: That day, crossing Harvard
Square, Allen spotted the January,

157
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,530
1975 issue of Popular Electronics
with the earth stopping headline,

158
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,900
World's First Minicomputer Kit
to Rival Commercial Models.

159
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,430
Beneath the headline was
a picture of a small box

160
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,160
adorned with lights and switches.

161
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,770
It was called the MITS Altair 8800.

162
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,100
And Allen knew this was what
he had been looking for.

163
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,350
>> HIKARI: Days of discussion followed.

164
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,170
Allen and Gates understood the
significance of the Altair.

165
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,480
They had talked often
about microprocessors

166
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,250
and were waiting to see what
would be done with them.

167
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,770
Now there was a minicomputer kit on
the cover of Popular Electronics.

168
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,830
It apparently had no software yet.

169
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,830
They imagined a nation of
programmers descending on MITS.

170
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,590
And so they called Ed Roberts,
the head of the company,

171
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,330
claiming to have a version of the
BASIC programming language almost ready

172
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,710
for the Altair.

173
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,570
They didn't.

174
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,910
And Roberts must have known they didn't.

175
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,170
He was getting 10 calls a day from
people who had a BASIC almost ready.

176
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,570
And his stock response
was, "The first person

177
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:11,090
who shows up with a working
BASIC gets the contract."

178
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,910
>> JAY PAUL: Gates and Allen
had never seen an Altair.

179
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,600
They had never even seen the
Intel 8080 microprocessor

180
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,060
at the heart of the Altair.

181
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,470
But a couple of years earlier
Allen had written a program

182
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,220
on a mainframe computer that emulated
the operation of a previous Intel

183
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,217
microprocessor.

184
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:28,300
And this time around they
would do the same thing.

185
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,530

186
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,380
>> HIKARI: With an Intel
8080 manual at his side,

187
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,770
Allen sat down at a
Harvard PDP-10 computer

188
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,010
and wrote the emulator and software
tools necessary to do the programming.

189
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,820
Meanwhile Gates stopped going
to classes and devoted himself

190
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,120
to designing the BASIC,
using every trick

191
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,130
he knew to get the size
down below 4 kilobytes.

192
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,870
>> JAY PAUL: Out in Albuquerque,
Ed Roberts got a call from Gates

193
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,754
asking for details about how the
Altair handled specific routines.

194
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:01,170
No one had ever asked that before.

195
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,670
And Roberts began to get interested.

196
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,240

197
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,970
>> HIKARI: With the development
tools and the design ready,

198
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,780
Gates and Allen wrote
the code on the PDP-10,

199
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:16,060
enlisting another Harvard student,
Monte Davidoff, to write math routines.

200
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,450
After a final night of
programming, Allen got on a plane

201
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,970
to deliver their BASIC to MITS.

202
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,800
He spent the plane ride out worrying.

203
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,490
And back in Cambridge
Gates was worrying.

204
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,100
They had tested their BASIC and
it had worked on the emulator.

205
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,444
But what if the emulator was wrong?

206
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:37,360
JAY PAUL: As the plane
approached Albuquerque,

207
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,070
Allen realized that their
BASIC, now neatly contained

208
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,460
on a small roll of
punched paper tape, would

209
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,970
be useless without a separate
program, called a loader, that

210
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,550
would tell the Altair how
to read the paper tape being

211
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,620
fed into the teletype machine.

212
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,970
He took out his notebook and quickly
scribbled down a loader program

213
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,819
in Assembly language, then manually
translated that into the 1s and 0s

214
00:09:56,819 --> 00:09:57,985
the Altair would understand.

215
00:09:57,985 --> 00:10:00,530

216
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,830
>> HIKARI: Allen was expecting a
clean, little, high tech company

217
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,470
run by men in business suits.

218
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,210
So he was surprised when Roberts met
him at the airport looking like a ranch

219
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,270
hand.

220
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,070
Roberts was also surprised.

221
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,340
When he dropped the Harvard
programmer at an expensive hotel,

222
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,790
Allen had to confess that
he couldn't afford the room.

223
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,510
>> JAY PAUL: MITS, itself, was
located in a dusty strip mall.

224
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,040
Inside on a cluttered
workbench was an Altair

225
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,390
loaded up with 5 kilobytes of
memory and connected by a cable

226
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,030
to a teletype machine.

227
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:37,200
Roberts and Chief Engineer,
Bill Yates, waited expectantly

228
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,660
as Allen toggled his loader
program into the Altair.

229
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,980
The teletype began chugging as it pulled
the paper tape through the tape reader.

230
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,215
It took perhaps 15 minutes
to load the program.

231
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:52,110
Then the teletype abruptly printed a
memory prompt, then a ready prompt,

232
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,340
and Allen began typing
a few test commands.

233
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,400
To everyone's amazement,
the software worked.

234
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,525
There were bugs, of course.

235
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:02,070
But the main thing was it worked.

236
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,570
>> HIKARI: Later, on their way to a
$3.00 lunch at Pancho's, a wasp flew

237
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,470
in the window of the pickup
truck and stung Allen on the arm.

238
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,070
But at that point nothing
could spoil the mood.

239
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,210
The Altair now had its BASIC, the
first commercial software for a home

240
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:23,260
computer, made by Paul Allen and Bill
Gates, doing business as Microsoft.

241
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,336
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Many
thanks to our two readers.

242
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:30,690
>> [APPLAUSE]

243
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,520
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Now
you have your choice,

244
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,880
before you leave, of a sparkly
or a glow in the dark-- oh,

245
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,810
wait one sec, wait-- sparkly
and a glow in the dark elephant

246
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,534
from CS50's own Cheng Gong.

247
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:43,450
HIKARI: Aw, thank you.

248
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,324
DAVID J. MALAN: All
right, thank you so much.

249
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:49,855
[APPLAUSE]

250
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:51,105
DAVID J. MALAN: So true story.

251
00:11:51,105 --> 00:11:54,380
This is to say that all of these
machines and the ease with which we

252
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,270
use them now and take
for granted, really

253
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,070
started here, just a few paces
from this actual theater.

254
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,930
And now today, if you've not been,
this is Maxwell Dworkin, the computer

255
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,810
sciences building,
also around the corner.

256
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:09,760
And on the second floor of this
building does hang three pages

257
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,740
from the original source code that
Bill Gates and Paul Allen wrote.

258
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,770
In fact, if use you zoom
in you can see not only

259
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,350
their names in the
original type, but also

260
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,100
their signatures that they adorned a
few years back when they last visited.

261
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,800
>> But what was particularly compelling
about this is what they set out to do

262
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,760
was to write a program that would
enable other people to write

263
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,950
their own programs.

264
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,280
At the time all there was with
this Altair machine made by MITS.

265
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:40,020
And all they needed was some way of
making it easy for hobbyists and people

266
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:45,300
like us in this room to actually program
that without necessarily understanding

267
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,060
Assembly code, or machine
code, or God forbid, 0s and 1s.

268
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,190
We programmers, like
those in this room, we

269
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,070
want to be able to express
ourselves much more like pseudo code

270
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,330
even if it's a bit more nit
picky than we talked last week.

271
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,970
We don't want to write code like this,
which Paul Allen and Bill Gates did.

272
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,850
We, instead, want to write code that
looks a little more user friendly.

273
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,150
>> Now this is a language known as BASIC.

274
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,497
And the line numbers there are what you
use to simply number the lines of code

275
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:12,330
that you're writing.

276
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,038
We don't even have to
do that these days.

277
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:16,060
But you can see here
how PRINT "hello, world"

278
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,660
would indeed presumably print just that.

279
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,710
And so what Bill and Paul did was
empower people to write code like this

280
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:27,240
instead of-- if you take a look at the
computer science wall-- code like this.

281
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,290
>> In fact, CS50 recently
had an opportunity

282
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,540
to sit down with Professor Harry Lewis
in the Computer Science department, who

283
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,640
actually taught Bill
Gates some years ago,

284
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,460
and is standing here before
those three pages of excerpts.

285
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,560
Let's take a look.

286
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,520
>> HARRY LEWIS: What you have here is a
listing of an early piece of software

287
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,240
written by Bill Gates and Paul
Allen, the founders of Microsoft.

288
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,570
So the code is interesting
for two reasons.

289
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,480
First of all, it became
Microsoft's first product,

290
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,810
which was an interpreter for
the BASIC programming language.

291
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,940
And secondly, this was
one of the first attempts

292
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,580
to create an interpreter so ordinary
people could use personal computers.

293
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,670
>> So Bill Gates was an
undergraduate at Harvard.

294
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,820
I started teaching at Harvard in 1974.

295
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,560
This was done in 1975.

296
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,180
So it was early in his career
and early in my career.

297
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,790
I actually taught Bill in
a course around this time.

298
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,130
Paul Allen was not a
Harvard student, but he

299
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,020
had been a high school
classmate of Bill Gates.

300
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,740
If you come and look
at the listing, you'll

301
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,230
actually find a third
name, Monte Davidoff,

302
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,260
who was Gates's classmate
here at Harvard.

303
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,340
>> OK, so here's an
interesting comment up here.

304
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:47,150
It says "In 4K can delete square root
but for loops should still work."

305
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:53,080
OK, so what that means is that there
were two ways to compile this program.

306
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,860
One was to run on a version
of this Altair computer

307
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:04,310
that only had 4K words of
memory, 4,096 words of memory.

308
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,050
But the big version had 8K.

309
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,770
And so what this says is
that in the 4K version

310
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,770
you had to delete some
code to make it fit.

311
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,790
And one of the things
that would be deleted

312
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,290
would be the square root routine.

313
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,360
But apparently the
for loops should still

314
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,392
work even when you're compiling down
for just the 4K version of the computer.

315
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,350
DAVID J. MALAN: So one of the themes,
as we'll see in computer science,

316
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,430
is this notion of
layering and abstraction,

317
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,670
and really standing on the shoulders
of folks who have come before us, not

318
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,890
unlike some of the Bill Gates
and Paul Allen narrative here.

319
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,080
And what this means is
that today we can take for

320
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,490
granted that things are actually
easier for us to write code.

321
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,170
Indeed code, as we said on Friday, is
more technically known as source code.

322
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:52,210
And it's this English like syntax
that's more proper and more well defined

323
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,480
than something like pseudo code, for
which there is no formal definition.

324
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,320
>> And today what we're going
to focus on is source code

325
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,010
that looks like this, which
admittedly at first glance

326
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,690
looks completely cryptic.

327
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:08,540
And frankly, it's way more aesthetically
complex than the underlying program is.

328
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,300
All this program does,
recall, is what did we say?

329
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,990
It just prints "hello world."

330
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,600
And yet look at all of the stuff we need
to wrap around that very simple phrase.

331
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,750
But before long all of
these lines and more

332
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,800
will make much better sense to you.

333
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,940
>> And the flow is as follows.

334
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,220
What we need at our disposal
is to take code, like source

335
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,340
code that we just saw.

336
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,060
And we need a new program
to run it through.

337
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,130
We need algorithms that can
convert source code, like this,

338
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,932
into object code, 0s and 1s.

339
00:16:41,932 --> 00:16:43,890
In other words, what
we're going to learn today

340
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,620
is how to do this, write
source code up top,

341
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,930
pass it as input to a special
program known as a compiler,

342
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,140
and we're going to produce object code.

343
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,600
Which is just a fancy way of
saying we will take something

344
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,350
that looks like this, pass it
into a program called a compiler,

345
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,210
producing object code
that looks like this.

346
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,720
>> So these are literally
the patterns of 0s and 1s

347
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,550
that are understood by an
Intel computer these days,

348
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,480
that if interpreted by the CPU,
the brains inside of a computer,

349
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,130
will literally print out,
quite simply, "hello world."

350
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,670
Now there's way more 0s and 1s than you
would hope might be necessary for that.

351
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,520
But that's because we're building
on a good deal of complexity

352
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,270
that we can henceforth take for granted.

353
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,869
In other words, a lot of smart people
have given us a lot of cool tools

354
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:32,480
and powerful software with which we
can now make projects of our own.

355
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,400
>> So let's get started.

356
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,640
Whereas last Friday, and
for Problem Set 0 this week,

357
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,000
you'll be playing in a
world that looks like this.

358
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,180
Starting today and for Problem
Set 1 next week, the code

359
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,410
is going to look a little more
cryptic, but functionally is

360
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,940
going to be the same.

361
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,770
So notice, top is Scratch,
bottom is C. Frankly Scratch

362
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,780
is a lot more user
friendly and accessible.

363
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,890
But if you now compare visually top to
bottom, there's kind of a one to one

364
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,690
correspondence between the
puzzle pieces and the language

365
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,870
we're about to play with.

366
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,420
In particular, say, the
blue puzzle piece up top,

367
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,370
is apparently equivalent to what keyword
or special phrase in this language

368
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,062
called C?

369
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:09,770
AUDIENCE: Printf.

370
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,728
DAVID J. MALAN: Printf.

371
00:18:10,728 --> 00:18:12,140
That means formatted printing.

372
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,240
And that's just a fancy
way of saying printf in C

373
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,615
is going to be a statement or a function
that prints something to the screen.

374
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:19,990
What does it print to the screen?

375
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,627
Whatever you tell it to inside
of quotes, inside of parentheses.

376
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:25,460
So again, admittedly,
there's a lot of stuff

377
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,990
that you have to keep in mind,
parentheses, quotes, semicolons,

378
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,656
and all of this.

379
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:30,600
But all of that is sort
of beside the point.

380
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,660
The interesting takeaway for now
is that the say block in Scratch

381
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,520
is pretty much equivalent to
the printf statement in C.

382
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,390
>> Meanwhile, the yellow puzzle piece
up top, when green flag clicked,

383
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,736
is probably equivalent
to what keyword here?

384
00:18:44,736 --> 00:18:45,360
AUDIENCE: Main.

385
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,359
DAVID J. MALAN: So main.

386
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,410
Maybe int, maybe void.

387
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,280
But main kind of sounds like
it's important, and indeed it is.

388
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,080
So when green flag clicked
is, again, the puzzle piece

389
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,390
that kicks off an
entire Scratch program.

390
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:02,140
But we are going to now start calling
that main, this function known as main.

391
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,410
>> Now meanwhile we'll
generalize this as follows.

392
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,780
We might call say a function.

393
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,580
And it might look
specifically like this.

394
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,770
Well, what about loops?

395
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:16,540
If we want to start converting or
translating more in Scratch to C,

396
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,400
this thing here apparently just
says "hello world" forever.

397
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,060
So if you associate these
scripts with a cat in Scratch,

398
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,560
it's just going to keep saying
in some kind of cartoon bubble,

399
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,922
"hello world, hello world, hello
world," ad nauseum, forever.

400
00:19:29,922 --> 00:19:33,130
If we want to do something similar in
C, it's going to look a little cryptic.

401
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,463
But we can achieve the same
results, as we'll eventually

402
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:36,861
find out, with syntax like this.

403
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:39,360
I'm going to use printf again,
because at the end of the day

404
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,040
I want to print "hello world."

405
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,610
And I'm apparently using a
keyword that isn't forever.

406
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,320
It's instead the word while.

407
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,650
But just semantically in
English, while kind of

408
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,120
suggests some kind of loop or cycle.

409
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,070
>> So that happens to be
the keyword that C uses.

410
00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:00,700
And while true, why does while
true effectively mean forever?

411
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,240
Well, while, as we'll soon
appreciate all the more,

412
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,140
has this parenthetical next to it
where you can put a Boolean expression.

413
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,360
And so long as that
expression is true, this code,

414
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,750
as denoted between these two
curly braces as we'll call them,

415
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,880
will just keep running again and again.

416
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,410
>> So true is true.

417
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,900
So while true means
just do this forever.

418
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,480
It's almost a stupid
construct to express yourself.

419
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,590
But there was no forever
keyword in C. There was while.

420
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,390
And there was a very simple
Boolean expression like true.

421
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,210
And so this, we'll see,
achieves the same result.

422
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,890
>> How else might you implement a loop?

423
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,980
Well, in Scratch you might
hard code a specific number

424
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,430
of iterations in the loop here.

425
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:43,210
And so that's exactly what we
might do in this version of C,

426
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,140
whereby we have a so-called for loop.

427
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,850
And the for loop here is going
to iterate, somewhat cryptically,

428
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:54,100
from the value 0 on up
to but less than 10.

429
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,955
>> Now variables in Scratch.

430
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,830
You might not have had
occasion to use these.

431
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:02,516
But what's the point, in general,
of a variable did we say last week?

432
00:21:02,516 --> 00:21:03,015
What's that?

433
00:21:03,015 --> 00:21:03,780
>> AUDIENCE: Points.

434
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,200
>> DAVID J. MALAN: To point?

435
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,700
Oh, points.

436
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,620
OK, keeping track of points,
for instance, in a game.

437
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,510
Or more generally doing
what with the variable?

438
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,450
What's the utility of them?

439
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:10,825
>> AUDIENCE: Memory.

440
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:11,750
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, so memory.

441
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,000
It's for storing something.

442
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,336
And the sort of silly visual I used
last time was like this glass bowl.

443
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:19,710
And if we wanted to store
something inside of a variable,

444
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,918
for instance right now the
value is six because there

445
00:21:21,918 --> 00:21:23,450
are six ping pong balls in here.

446
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,158
It's just some kind of storage
container that underneath the hood

447
00:21:26,158 --> 00:21:30,030
is implemented with bits, 0s and 1s,
however a computer happens to do that.

448
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,900
>> So in Scratch, if we
want to have a variable,

449
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,840
we can use an orange block like this.

450
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,050
We'll call that counter
in this particular case.

451
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,890
I initialized it to 0.

452
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,080
And what it I then do?

453
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,780
Forever, say counter, which if
you play with that in Scratch,

454
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,780
you'll just see Scratch.

455
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,920
The cat or whatever costume you put on
him will speak the number in question.

456
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,840
>> Change counter by 1 is
like incrementing by 1.

457
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,580
And so this is going to
count from what so what?

458
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,114
From 0 til infinity, or
until Scratch breaks,

459
00:21:59,114 --> 00:22:01,030
or until you sort of
lose interest in watching

460
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,650
how high he can actually count.

461
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,800
>> So how might we convert this to C?

462
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,480
It's going to look a little cryptic.

463
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,896
But again, if you look at each
of these lines individually

464
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,410
they kind of lineup generally.

465
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,526
So apparently int is going to
have some special meaning in C.

466
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:14,400
We'll see that again.

467
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,810
As an aside it means integer.

468
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:16,990
So it just means number.

469
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,920
So that's the type of
glass bowl I want, one

470
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,120
that can store numbers,
not ping pong balls.

471
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,520
And I'm going to use the equal sign
there to assign it a value of 0.

472
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,440
So that's quite like set
counter to 0, but in C.

473
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,840
>> Meanwhile, while true, that was
equivalent, of course, to forever,

474
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,980
even though it's a little cryptic,
and then inside of the curly braces.

475
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,188
And you can think of these curly braces,
which you can type on your keyboard,

476
00:22:39,188 --> 00:22:43,110
as really being like the curvature in
these yellow loop blocks in Scratch.

477
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,700
It embraces multiple lines of code.

478
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,120
>> Printf is getting a
little scary now because I

479
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,120
see not only quotes in parentheses.

480
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,160
But what else is new
syntactically in this example?

481
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,300
There's a percent d.

482
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,551
And then backslash n is there.

483
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:00,883
We did see that before, even
though I didn't mention it.

484
00:23:00,883 --> 00:23:01,886
Then there's a comma.

485
00:23:01,886 --> 00:23:03,010
And then there's a counter.

486
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,010
>> But we'll see in just a
moment that this is just

487
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,080
a standard way of saying print a
"decimal number," quote, unquote,

488
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,500
some decimal number.

489
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,370
But I'm going to tell you later
what that decimal number is.

490
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,835
So the fact that there's a comma
in this line saying printf,

491
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:18,710
means go ahead and print
some decimal number.

492
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:23,110
Oh, and by the way, the number is
whatever the value of this variable is.

493
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,880
And so to make this more
clear, we'll see an example

494
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,930
before long involving exactly printf
in the context of real C programs.

495
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,472
>> Now just to wrap up some
of these constructs.

496
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:36,680
Boolean expressions, you might not have
occasion to use these in your program

497
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,450
but you might very well,
especially if using conditions.

498
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:43,460
And so these two examples from
Scratch mean if x is less than y,

499
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,770
or if x is less than y and y is less
than z, how might we translate that?

500
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,810
>> Well, in C it's just
going to look like this.

501
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:55,300
A little cryptic, more parentheses,
some weird ampersands, but fundamentally

502
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,160
the ideas are as simple as they
are in the puzzle piece world.

503
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,690
We're simply checking if something
is less than something else.

504
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,910
>> How about conditions?

505
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:09,710
In a nutshell in English, what does this
chunk of Scratch code do would you say?

506
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,050
>> AUDIENCE: Compares two numbers.

507
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,760
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Compares two
numbers, and if x is less than y

508
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,860
it says as much.

509
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,080
If x is greater than y
it says as much, else

510
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,740
if x is equal to y it says as much.

511
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,180
Now where did x and y come from?

512
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:22,680
Who knows.

513
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,380
This chunk of Scratch
code is out of context.

514
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,050
But what we want to do now is translate
this for just a moment to see.

515
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,660
>> So as you get comfortable
this week in Problem Set

516
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,190
0 playing in this world
on the left, realize

517
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,940
that the ideas aren't changing
this week or next or beyond.

518
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,690
We're simply going to
start writing things

519
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,240
in a different way with our
keyboard instead of our mouse.

520
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,577
>> So if x is less than y, and
there's some parentheses there,

521
00:24:44,577 --> 00:24:47,160
then there's some curly braces
again to kind of encapsulate it

522
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,970
just like the yellow puzzle pieces do.

523
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,000
And I'm going to printf x
is less than y and so forth.

524
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,540
>> What is nice about C,
as you can see here,

525
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,480
is that you don't get this nesting,
nesting, nesting that's necessarily

526
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,220
going to push your code to the right.

527
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,990
You can instead have everything
lineup neatly like this.

528
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:08,960
But that's just an aesthetic
detail we'll see again before long.

529
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,660
>> All right.

530
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,290
So that brings us back to
this cryptic looking program.

531
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,180
Let's actually write some code.

532
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,830
Now how do you go about writing code?

533
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,310
All these years that you've owned
a Mac or PC, desktop or laptop,

534
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,520
you've actually had the capability
to start writing programming code.

535
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,050
But you're probably missing
a special type of program.

536
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,470
You can certainly write code.

537
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,740
But you can't necessarily,
out of the box,

538
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,210
convert that source code
into object code, 0s and 1s

539
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,619
without what on your computer?

540
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:36,410
AUDIENCE: Compiler.

541
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,630
DAVID J. MALAN: So a compiler, right.

542
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,730
Now most of you probably
don't own a compiler,

543
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,259
have never downloaded a compiler.

544
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:44,300
But you'll see you can download it
like most any other piece of software.

545
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,470
In the world of Mac OS, you might
download or have downloaded already

546
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:50,437
something called Xcode or GCC or Clang.

547
00:25:50,437 --> 00:25:52,270
If you come from the
Windows world you might

548
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:56,190
have downloaded Visual Studio,
Visual Basic, environments like that.

549
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,200
There's dozens of compilers
these days that you might use.

550
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,940
But the short of it here
is that it would be a pain

551
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,480
and, frankly, a technological
nightmare for hundreds

552
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,680
of people with different
computer configurations to all

553
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,800
configure their machines
in exactly the same way

554
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,700
so that we can all be on the same page.

555
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,240
>> So what we, instead, do
in CS50 is we give you

556
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,349
a standard environment, a
Linux environment that's

557
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:20,140
going to look a little
something like this.

558
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,980
You'll see more of this in the
Problem Set 1 specification which

559
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,330
will go online this Friday night.

560
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,360
>> And what this means
is that you henceforth

561
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,060
are going to be able to
download and install a program

562
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,650
called the CS50 Appliance.

563
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,275
And you're going to download and
install another program called

564
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:40,300
a hypervisor, which is just a
fancy way of achieving this.

565
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,600
Whether you own a Mac or PC or a
Linux computer or a Solaris computer,

566
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,830
or whatever crazy operating
system you're running,

567
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,820
you're going to download a program
called the hypervisor that's

568
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,350
going to run the CS50
Appliance on your computer

569
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,430
no matter what your operating system is.

570
00:26:55,430 --> 00:27:00,640
A hypervisor in other words converts
our stuff to whatever language,

571
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,850
whatever instructions your
own computer understands.

572
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,962
>> So this is a layering.

573
00:27:04,962 --> 00:27:06,920
And again, this is kind
of thematic in computer

574
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,722
science, the building on top of things.

575
00:27:08,722 --> 00:27:09,680
You might have Windows.

576
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,710
You might have Mac OS.

577
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,960
But starting next week you're
going to have downloaded

578
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,980
a free piece of software
called the hypervisor.

579
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,800
You're going to have downloaded a piece
of software called the CS50 Appliance.

580
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,050
>> That's going to run in the hypervisor,
which is going to run on your computer.

581
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,030
And the end result is
that all of us will

582
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:26,220
have a simple window like
this on your Mac or PC

583
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,160
that gives us the illusion of all
running the same operating system,

584
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,800
without any other
impact on your computer.

585
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,870
And you can full screen
it and essentially behave

586
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,550
as though you are running an
operating system called Linux,

587
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:40,270
which is what the CS50
Appliance is based on.

588
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,930
>> So let's actually use this
now to write a program.

589
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,450
You can write a program
using Microsoft Word.

590
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,160
You can write a program
using TextEdit, or Notepad,

591
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,880
or WordPad, or pretty much any word
processing program you've ever used.

592
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,174
But the reality is you shouldn't
use really any of those programs.

593
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,840
You certainly shouldn't use
something like Microsoft Word, which

594
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,120
has bold facing and italics, and
bigger fonts and smaller fonts,

595
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,560
because the computer doesn't
care about any of that.

596
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,600
All the computer is
going to care about is

597
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,040
English like instructions written in C.

598
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,050
>> So what we'll do inside
of the CS50 Appliance

599
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,290
is use a program freely
available, and it's

600
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:17,360
pre-installed in this
appliance, called Gedit.

601
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,280
And Gedit is just a super simple
text editor like Mac OS's TextEdit,

602
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,200
like Windows Notepad that's going to
look a little something like this.

603
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,910
>> So let's actually not
look at slides of this.

604
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:32,580
But let's actually go into
the environment itself.

605
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,090
I'm going to go ahead and
log in, in this other window,

606
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,910
to my CS50 Appliance, which I've
pre-installed on my laptop here.

607
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,771
>> Notice that, like Windows and
Mac OS, it's got some menus.

608
00:28:43,771 --> 00:28:45,520
Like Windows it puts
it down there instead

609
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,020
of Mac OS, which puts it down there.

610
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,930
But the reality is it's
all kind of the same.

611
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,770
And in here is a whole
bunch of software.

612
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,770
There's Dropbox.

613
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,780
There's a whole bunch of accessories,
graphical programs that we'll

614
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,430
use later in the term for problem sets.

615
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,650
There's a web browser built in so
that this is a full fledged computer

616
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,240
inside of a computer.

617
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,170
>> But I'm going to click this
leftmost white icon here,

618
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,890
which is the icon for Gedit.

619
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:09,650
And it's going to open a window
that has three panels to it,

620
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:12,590
a left one, a top one, and a bottom one.

621
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,071
>> Now it's in this top right one that
I'm going to actually write some code.

622
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:16,820
So let's do this,.

623
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,040
I'm going to go to File, Save.

624
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,100
And you might not ever have seen
this particular window before.

625
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,620
But this is like Mac OS or Windows.

626
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,490
It's just a window
with all of the folders

627
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,290
that I have inside of this computer.

628
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,320
>> And I'm going to save
the file as hello.c.

629
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,690
And I'm going to go
ahead and click Save.

630
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,364
And now notice I have a tab
at top left called hello.c.

631
00:29:36,364 --> 00:29:38,280
So probably pretty
familiar even if you've not

632
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,240
used this particular program before.

633
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,890
>> And now I'm going to type in those
fairly cryptic sequence of commands

634
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,360
that we saw a moment ago.

635
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,330
Include, standard I/O.h.

636
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,600
More on that soon.

637
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,670
Int main void, open curly
brace, closed curly brace.

638
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:01,570
And then inside of there I think is
where we had "hello world," semicolon.

639
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,100
And now save.

640
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:08,780
>> So this is a program written in C,
written, therefore, in source code.

641
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,720
But I can't just run this program.

642
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,390
I kind of want to double
click on an icon somewhere,

643
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,390
but no icon exists other
than the source code file.

644
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:20,359
What, again, is the process now that
I need to run this file through?

645
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,150
AUDIENCE: Compiler.

646
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,399
DAVID J. MALAN: So a compiler.

647
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,890
So in different computers you
do this in different ways.

648
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,480
But what we've done here in
the CS50 Appliance that's

649
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,260
representative of how you might
do this on many different systems,

650
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,036
is I'm simply going to
run a command called make.

651
00:30:34,036 --> 00:30:35,660
And make is literally going to do that.

652
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,640
Make me a program.

653
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,060
>> So make is going to
run a compiler for me.

654
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,160
And the name of the program
I want to make is hello.

655
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,510
Now make is a program.

656
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:47,170
And make is smart enough to
realize that if I say make hello,

657
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:50,980
it's going to look automatically
for a file called hello.c

658
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,420
just because that's the
way it's configured.

659
00:30:53,420 --> 00:31:00,300
>> So when I now hit Enter here, this
crazy cryptic line just got executed.

660
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,720
And trust me, before
long, within just days,

661
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,590
you'll understand what all
of that nonsense means.

662
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:11,150
But for now, just know that make
triggered execution of a compiler.

663
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,290
In other words, it found
a compiler on my computer

664
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,820
that's pre-installed
on the CS50 Appliance

665
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,560
that we'll hand to you in Problem Set 1.

666
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,990
And it then took hello.c as
input, and produced apparently

667
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,040
0s and 1s as output.

668
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,410
>> And by default what it does is it saves
those 0s and 1s in a file called hello.

669
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:33,180
And though this syntax too might
be new to you, simply by saying dot

670
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,110
slash hello is going to be the
means by which I run this program.

671
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,360
>> For now and for at least a couple
of weeks, almost all of the programs

672
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,230
we write are going to be in
black and white text windows.

673
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,006
No mice, no clicking,
no windows, no icons.

674
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:49,630
We're going to keep it simple
and focus on the underlying ideas

675
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,490
initially before we get to something
higher level, for instance,

676
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,410
like the break out game that we talked
about in the first lecture last week.

677
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,820
>> So when I hit Enter here, it's
equivalent in a text only environment

678
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,272
to double clicking an icon called hello.

679
00:32:03,272 --> 00:32:05,480
What do you expect will
happen when I hit Enter then?

680
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,120
>> AUDIENCE: It'll print "hello world."

681
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,000
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Hopefully
it will print "hello world."

682
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,370
And indeed it did.

683
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,690
Now there's been some
cryptic syntax here.

684
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,950
Let's rewind for just
a moment and see if we

685
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:19,530
can't start inferring just by
tinkering, trying and failing,

686
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,130
as to what's going on here.

687
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,609
What if I get rid of the backslash n?

688
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,650
Now some of you who've
programmed before probably

689
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,054
know instantly what that means.

690
00:32:27,054 --> 00:32:29,220
But for those of you who've
never programmed before,

691
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,052
at least think to yourself what is going
to change when I rerun this program?

692
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:37,010
So I'm going to go back down to my
little black and white window, which

693
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,290
is the window in which
I can compile this.

694
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,130
I'm going to recompile hello.

695
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,520
We're going to see the same
cryptic sequence of commands.

696
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,719
And I'm going to do dot slash hello.

697
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:48,260
And now someone, if you would,
who's never programmed before,

698
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,770
what might be different this time?

699
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,020
Yeah.

700
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,840
>> AUDIENCE: It won't stop
printing "hello world."

701
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,660
>> DAVID J. MALAN: It's going to-- sorry?

702
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,210
>> AUDIENCE: It won't stop printing it?

703
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,810
>> DAVID J. MALAN: It won't
stop printing "hello world."

704
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,560
So not a bad idea.

705
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,633
Other ideas?

706
00:32:58,633 --> 00:32:59,132
Yeah.

707
00:32:59,132 --> 00:33:00,060
>> AUDIENCE: Error message?

708
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,750
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Error
message, OK, could be.

709
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,250
What else?

710
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,479
AUDIENCE: It might print the
bracket with the semicolon as well?

711
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:08,270
DAVID J. MALAN: Might print the
bracket with the semicolon as well.

712
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,950
So maybe that backslash then is some
kind of terminous that's important.

713
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,860
Any other thoughts?

714
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,412
>> So all good ideas.

715
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:18,370
And in fact, it's going
to be an error message.

716
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,400
That's probably most likely
to be the answer in general

717
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,420
for the next few weeks
as we learn to code here.

718
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:27,680
>> But for now remember that computers
only do what you tell them to do.

719
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,400
Much like the ridiculous peanut
butter and jelly example.

720
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,860
Our human computers were only supposed
to do what you told them to do.

721
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,250
So in this case, if you
don't tell the computer

722
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:41,190
to move that blinking cursor to the
next line, it's not going to do it.

723
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:45,390
So when I run this program
now, notice the difference.

724
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,900
>> Looks like a bug.

725
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,190
It's an aesthetic bug, perhaps.

726
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,310
But what is different about this
output versus the last one obviously?

727
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:53,810
Yeah.

728
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:54,920
>> AUDIENCE: It didn't do a new line.

729
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,586
>> DAVID J. MALAN: It didn't do a new line.

730
00:33:56,586 --> 00:33:58,740
Now those of you who
have maybe made web pages

731
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,910
before, you might know of the
BR tag or the paragraph tag,

732
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,120
very similar in spirit.

733
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,680
A web browser will ignore you until
you tell it exactly what to do.

734
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,020
Similarly, is a language like C only
going to do what you tell it to do.

735
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,730
>> So the reason that
all of these examples,

736
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,350
thus far, have kind of
casually had this backslash

737
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,560
in there, that's the means
by which you express yourself

738
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,380
as a new line character, so to speak.

739
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:26,219
And you can kind of appreciate, perhaps,
that this would look kind of stupid

740
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,070
if nothing else.

741
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,150
If I wanted a new line, just
hitting Enter and then kind

742
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,219
of butchering the code like that
shouldn't really rub you the right way.

743
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,830
And even if you don't
really care at this point,

744
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,830
you will realize that
this is not a particularly

745
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,870
good looking piece of code.

746
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,969
>> And so what the world
decided years ago is

747
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:43,420
that when you want to put the
cursor onto a new line explicitly,

748
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,332
you must explicitly say
new line, backslash n.

749
00:34:46,332 --> 00:34:48,040
And there's some other
symbols like that.

750
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,719
But for now we'll just
focus on backslash n.

751
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,790
>> Now let's make the program
a little more interesting.

752
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:59,200
I'm going to go ahead and
this time open up a new file.

753
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,520
I'm going to save this as hello-1.c.

754
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,540
And just for kicks, I'm going to
go put it into my Dropbox folder.

755
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,030
>> As you'll see in the CS50
documentation for the appliance,

756
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,210
later this week for Problem
Set 1, we'll encourage

757
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,230
you to use Dropbox or
some equivalent service,

758
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,430
because then all of your code's
going to be backed up automatically.

759
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,830
And so that's why I've
gone into this folder here.

760
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,230
>> And now I'm going to write a
slightly different program.

761
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,740
Include, standard I/O.h, int main void.

762
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,660
And then in here printf, hello world,
which is exactly the same as before.

763
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,450
>> But now I want to print something
that's a little different.

764
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,800
I want to print out,
say, "Hello, David."

765
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,590
All right, so obviously,
it should hopefully

766
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,360
be the case that if I recompile
this program, rerun it,

767
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,840
it's going to say "hello, David."

768
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,160
>> But what if I want to introduce
this sort of variable,

769
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,240
the notion of a container that's going
to store D-a-v-i-d and not hard code it

770
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,600
into my program.

771
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,430
Well what if I start
doing something like this?

772
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:57,120
>> String s, so this is a variable.

773
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,250
If you want a string,
a.k.a. a word or a phrase.

774
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,485
A sequence of characters is what
we in programming call a string.

775
00:36:03,485 --> 00:36:06,610
We're just going to generically call
it s, because it's a nice simple name.

776
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,010
But I could call it anything.

777
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:12,920
>> I'm going to say string s equals
quote unquote, "David," semicolon.

778
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,330
And now I want to insert
D-a-v-i-d into what I'm printing.

779
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:23,720
And before we saw a teaser on
the screen of some special syntax

780
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,050
that allowed us to
substitute in a value.

781
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,250
What was the special
symbol a few slides ago?

782
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,040
>> So percent.

783
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,830
At the time it was percent
d for decimal number.

784
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,850
That doesn't really seem relevant here.

785
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,650
Turns out there's
another percent symbol,

786
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,810
which is percent s, which stands
for a placeholder for a string.

787
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:49,350
>> So now, very simply, I'm
going to go make hello-1,

788
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:54,210
because this file's called
hello-1.c, and hit Enter.

789
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,230
And I screwed up.

790
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,394
What's going on?

791
00:36:57,394 --> 00:37:00,560
Well, here's where we have to begin to
appreciate that we're in this command

792
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,810
line environment, this
text only environment.

793
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:06,114
There's no clicking on icons
like folders right now.

794
00:37:06,114 --> 00:37:07,280
And think back a moment ago.

795
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,740
In what folder did I say
I was saving my code?

796
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,657
So the Dropbox folder.

797
00:37:11,657 --> 00:37:12,989
Could have been called anything.

798
00:37:12,989 --> 00:37:14,530
But it happens to be called Dropbox.

799
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:18,380
So I somehow need to double click on
that Dropbox folder in order to get

800
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,657
into it and get at my
code called hello-1.c.

801
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:24,490
In fact, let me go ahead and minimize
this window for just a moment.

802
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:27,560
Just like Windows and Mac OS,
there are folders in Linux.

803
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,410
There are folders in the CS50 Appliance.

804
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:32,380
It's just right now we're confining
ourselves to this text environment.

805
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,700
>> But if I double click
on Dropbox, notice there

806
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,210
is the file that I want to compile.

807
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:41,430
But I need this black and white
terminal window, so to speak.

808
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:45,750
But I need, therefore, to move
into that folder or directory.

809
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,290
So slightly arcane, but
you'll get used to this too.

810
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,430
>> In the world of Linux,
which again is the operating

811
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:54,860
system we're running inside of the CS50
Appliance, there's a command called CD.

812
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,310
Which means I can do CD, space, Dropbox.

813
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,900
CD, change directory.

814
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,400
Right.

815
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,890
Back in the day when people were
inventing computers and operating

816
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,806
systems like this, they wanted to
type the fewest keystrokes possible.

817
00:38:05,806 --> 00:38:08,760
So the easiest way to say
change directory was CD.

818
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,910
>> So if I hit CD, space Dropbox,
notice what has changed here.

819
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,480
Inside of parentheses
the appliance is kind

820
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,360
of humoring me and
reminding me where I am.

821
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,480
So the open folder is Dropbox.

822
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,950
If I now type ls for
list, again succinct,

823
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,540
because people didn't want to
type back in the day l-i-s-t.

824
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,300
So they instead made it ls.

825
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,110
>> Enter.

826
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:35,740
Notice I see two things, hello-1.c,
and then this cryptic thing, source 1m.

827
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,310
That's just my way of saying
source code for week 1 Monday.

828
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,020
That's a folder I downloaded from
CS50's website that I made earlier today

829
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,990
and just put it into the
appliance in advance.

830
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,550
>> But for now the only thing we
care about is making this program.

831
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,440
So when I type make hello-1, Enter.

832
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,320
Damn it.

833
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,060
Something went wrong.

834
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,580
So let's tease this apart.

835
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:58,489
And unfortunately this is where things
get a little stressful at first,

836
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:00,280
at least if you've
never programmed before.

837
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:00,980
>> My god.

838
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,990
I wrote a two line program and
I have four lines of errors.

839
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:07,180
So what's going on here.

840
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,370
First and foremost always scroll back
up and find the first error message,

841
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:15,730
because oftentimes compilers just
get confused by what you and I do.

842
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,000
Compilers are pretty dumb.

843
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,360
They'll only do what
you tell them to do.

844
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,484
And if you confuse them, they're just
going to kind of throw up their hands

845
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:25,010
and maybe throw more error messages
than are actually relevant.

846
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,380
>> So let's look at the first.

847
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,540
Super cryptic at first.

848
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,050
But notice, here's the name of the
file in which I screwed up apparently.

849
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:36,570
Colon 5, colon 5 just means on
line 5 at the fifth character.

850
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,760
So fifth column of characters,
if you will, error.

851
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,870
Use of undeclared identifier string.

852
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,120
Did you mean standard n?

853
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,850
>> No, I meant string.

854
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,640
And then it's kind of
copying and pasting

855
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,700
what I typed to really draw my
attention to where I screwed up.

856
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,260
So for some reason C,
or at least the compiler

857
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,470
does not understand the word string.

858
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,890
And that's because we made it up.

859
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,440
So string does not exist
in C. What CS50 does,

860
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,380
for the first few weeks
only of the class,

861
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,700
is we provide some training
wheels, so to speak.

862
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:11,160
And we put these training wheels
inside of a special file called CS50.h.

863
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,970
>> So this is the second of two file
names that apparently end in dot h.

864
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,300
Let's rewind.

865
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,360
Printf is a statement or function
that apparently prints something

866
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,580
to the screen.

867
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,470
But you didn't see me
implement printf, right.

868
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:26,360
Someone years ago implemented printf.

869
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,420
In what file would you wager he
or she put the implementation

870
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,270
for printf, the code for printf?

871
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,860
>> In a file called standard I/O.h.

872
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,930
In fact, it's probably in
two files, standard I/O.h,

873
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,650
which stands for header
file, and standard I/O.c,

874
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,060
which stands for C source code.

875
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,220
So he or she some years ago plopped
the code that they wrote into that file

876
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,240
so that people like us
years later can include it,

877
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,040
so to speak, in our own programs.

878
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,320
>> And indeed, that's what the pound sign
followed by the word include does.

879
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,250
It looks on the local hard drive,
finds the file called standard I/O.h,

880
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,840
and then effectively copies and
pastes it inside of my own file.

881
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,210
So now my program knows
how to print to the screen.

882
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:11,120
>> So by that logic, where
is string defined?

883
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,260
>> AUDIENCE: CS50.h.

884
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,290
>> DAVID J. MALAN: CS50.h.

885
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:15,540
And indeed, that's what we,
the core staff, have done.

886
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,590
We've invented a few data types,
so to speak, like a string,

887
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:22,370
in addition to ones you
get for free, like an int.

888
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:26,010
And we'll see others like a char
for a character and a few more.

889
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:30,670
Inside of CS50.h apparently is
at least some mention of string.

890
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,980
>> So now let me go ahead
and rerun make hello-1.

891
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,100
I'll zoom in again and cross my fingers.

892
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:41,370
Now by having made one
change I fixed most things.

893
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,100
But damn it.

894
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,290
More percents than data arguments.

895
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,980
What did I do wrong this time?

896
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,420
>> So it's still pretty cryptic.

897
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,560
But this error is on
line 7 and character 21.

898
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,880
So let's go look up here.

899
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,350
It's a little subtle.

900
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:59,167
But if you think about what
the fundamental ideas here are,

901
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,500
perhaps we can tease this apart.

902
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,300
>> So printf is the name of the function.

903
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,960
Parentheses, thus far, is
just like what we put around

904
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,005
the stuff we're passing
as inputs to a function.

905
00:42:07,005 --> 00:42:08,921
All right, just an
arbitrary human convention.

906
00:42:08,921 --> 00:42:09,919
Use parentheses.

907
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:12,460
Inside of those parentheses
we've been putting double quotes,

908
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,810
and then a string like "hello world."

909
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:18,160
>> But in that earlier example very
briefly did we look at with Scratch.

910
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,590
And we had the percent d, what else
was inside of those parentheses

911
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,730
that I called out verbally?

912
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:24,230
Yeah.

913
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:28,166
>> AUDIENCE: So it's what you're taking
[INAUDIBLE] from within [INAUDIBLE]

914
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:30,200
what these [INAUDIBLE]?

915
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
DAVID J. MALAN: Exactly.

916
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,700
So we had the percent d.

917
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,620
But then we had close
quote, comma, counter.

918
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,120
Right.

919
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,680
We specified what we want
to do as the placeholder.

920
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,621
So what I'm going to do here is
comma, what do you want me to put?

921
00:42:44,621 --> 00:42:45,120
AUDIENCE: S.

922
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,828
DAVID J. MALAN: S,
because s in this case

923
00:42:46,828 --> 00:42:48,700
is the name of the storage container.

924
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,180
It's the name of that glass bowl.

925
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,610
Whereas before it was counter in that
simple Scratch example we looked at.

926
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:56,630
So now having made two
changes, let me zoom in

927
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,800
and try once more to
compile this program.

928
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,596
>> Now I see that cryptic line.

929
00:43:01,596 --> 00:43:03,470
But that's actually the
name of the compiler.

930
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,886
Clang is the name of the compiler.

931
00:43:04,886 --> 00:43:07,100
Make is just saving me
the headache of ever

932
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,830
typing that long crazy command out.

933
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:14,900
So now if I do dot slash hello-1,
I should see "hello, David."

934
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,450
>> Pretty underwhelming, though, right?

935
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:18,158
We could have done
this a lot more simply

936
00:43:18,158 --> 00:43:20,940
without talking about variables
and CS50.h and all of that.

937
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,080
So let's make it a
little more interesting.

938
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:31,010
>> In addition to CS50.h,
having things like string

939
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:34,550
declared, the CS50 library
also has a few functions.

940
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:38,520
So just like years ago, someone wrote
printf and put it in standard I/O.h

941
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,530
and some other file.

942
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:44,010
>> We, the CS50 staff, wrote a function
called GetChar, GetDouble, GetFloat,

943
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:47,610
GetInt, GetLongLong, GetString,
and we put those inside a file

944
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:49,890
called CS50.h and CS50.c.

945
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,880
And we put them inside
of the CS50 Appliance.

946
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,880
And people can also
download them online if they

947
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,880
want to put them on their
own computers as well.

948
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,880
Which is to say that we have created
functions that get input from the user.

949
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,930
I don't know what all
of these data types are.

950
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:06,490
GetInt is kind of straightforward, like
get an integer somehow from the user.

951
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:09,980
And GetString is probably like get
a word or a sentence from the user.

952
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,770
>> So let's focus on that.

953
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,710
And I'm going to go back into the
appliance and I'm going to go ahead

954
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:20,790
and save this file as, let's call
it hello-2.c as my second version.

955
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,030
And let's make a couple of changes.

956
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,800
>> This time instead of
hard coding David, which

957
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,120
makes an incredibly consistent
but underwhelming program,

958
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,640
what if I instead do GetString?

959
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,660
Now notice GetString
has an open parenthesis,

960
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,500
closed parenthesis, because
it doesn't need any input.

961
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,850
It's just going to go get
a string from the user.

962
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,460
>> And now a word on other syntax.

963
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,439
Semicolons just end a line of code.

964
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,730
You don't need them everywhere.

965
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,896
But that just means I'm
done with this line of code.

966
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:51,080
Let me move onto another
statement or function.

967
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,010
String declares a variable.

968
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:55,920
String is like saying
give me a bowl, please.

969
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,940
And let me put a string in it.

970
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,430
>> And now the equal sign.

971
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,510
What is the equal sign
essentially equivalent to?

972
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,500
>> AUDIENCE: Assign.

973
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,190
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, assigning a value.

974
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:09,872
So if I, for instance, call
this function GetString,

975
00:45:09,872 --> 00:45:12,830
and we'll see in a moment that's
going to prompt the user for a string.

976
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:17,810
This is like letting me then write
D-a-v-i-d on a piece of paper.

977
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:21,060
And when I say string
s equals GetString,

978
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,140
equal doesn't really mean
equal in C programming.

979
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,880
It means assign from the right
hand side to the left hand side.

980
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,510
>> So I've gotten a string.

981
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:32,785
And the equal sign means put it
in the storage container called s.

982
00:45:32,785 --> 00:45:36,730
And Then pass this off to
printf to actually do its thing.

983
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:39,790
>> So the end result then is going
to look a little different.

984
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:40,840
Let's do make hello-2.

985
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,940

986
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,260
Either could work.

987
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,450
You're following along.

988
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:47,940
Make hello-2 worked.

989
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,640
Dot slash hello-2, Enter.

990
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,620
>> I seem to have an infinite
loop or something.

991
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,453
Nothing's happening.

992
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:56,134
Why?

993
00:45:56,134 --> 00:45:57,805
>> AUDIENCE: It's making an infinite loop.

994
00:45:57,805 --> 00:45:59,430
DAVID J. MALAN: It is an infinite loop.

995
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:02,710
It's kind of waiting for me to
actually provide it with some input.

996
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,800
So let me go ahead and type
in David, and hit Enter.

997
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,230
And now it says "hello, David."

998
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,040
If I run it again.

999
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,530
Let's type in Rob, "hello, Rob."

1000
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:13,900
>> Now this is the worst
user interface ever.

1001
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,110
The user's apparently
supposed to know what to do.

1002
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,120
But no matter.

1003
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,570
Using these same building
blocks just like in Scratch,

1004
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:24,980
we can solve that problem and say
something like your name please, colon,

1005
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,820
space, closed quote, close
parenthesis, semicolon.

1006
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,680
So a lot of again
silliness with the syntax.

1007
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,040
>> But notice I've just added a
puzzle piece above this one

1008
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,280
and above this one.

1009
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,870
So now if I rerun this, hello-2, Enter.

1010
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,180
Wait a minute.

1011
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:41,830
What's wrong?

1012
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:43,570
It's not behaving any differently.

1013
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:44,200
Yeah.

1014
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,010
>> AUDIENCE: You didn't run make again.

1015
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,968
>> DAVID J. MALAN: I didn't
run make again, right.

1016
00:46:47,968 --> 00:46:49,430
So I've changed my source code.

1017
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:50,638
But again, there's that flow.

1018
00:46:50,638 --> 00:46:54,530
Source code through the compiler gives
you new object code, or 0s and 1s.

1019
00:46:54,530 --> 00:47:00,209
So I need to actually
rerun make hello-2 Enter.

1020
00:47:00,209 --> 00:47:01,750
OK, something seems to have happened.

1021
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:04,220
Dot slash hello-2.

1022
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,390
Your name please.

1023
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:09,990
And to be clear now, why is
the cursor on the same line?

1024
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:10,490
Exactly.

1025
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:13,020
I didn't put the backslash
n up here in my code.

1026
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,110
So now I can write
something like Daven, Enter.

1027
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:18,710
I can run it again and type
something like Gabe, Enter,

1028
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,250
and we get a different program
again and again and again.

1029
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:28,940
>> Now ultimately we're going to need
to use a few different capabilities.

1030
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,860
We need to introduce ultimately some
conditions to do things conditionally.

1031
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,550
Maybe loops so we can do
things again and again.

1032
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:38,220
>> Maybe it would be nice if we
could implement our own functions,

1033
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,355
like we could implement our own
printf or our own version of GetString

1034
00:47:41,355 --> 00:47:45,870
and GetFlow, because ultimately even
using this command line environment

1035
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:49,780
can we do even the most
visually interesting of things.

1036
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,950
>> Indeed in conclusion let me do this.

1037
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:54,020
I'm going to go ahead
and close these windows

1038
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:57,400
and open this icon here,
which is just a bigger

1039
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,020
version of that embedded
terminal window.

1040
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,329
So Gedit has not only
the place for my code,

1041
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:05,620
but also a built in terminal window, the
black and white window where I can run

1042
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,230
commands.

1043
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,600
>> I just happened to open
a bigger version of this.

1044
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,170
And now I'm going to go into
the folder that I've already

1045
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:13,150
put in advance on the course's website.

1046
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,720
And I'm going to go ahead and
open a file called thadgavin.c,

1047
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,710
which was written by someone else.

1048
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:21,220
>> And if we look at this,
this is not the kind of code

1049
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:24,370
we'll be writing since
the goal of this code

1050
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:28,450
was to write the prettiest
looking code that he or she could,

1051
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,290
irrespective of whether or not
another human being could ever

1052
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:33,660
understand this code.

1053
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,050
>> Indeed, every year there's what's
called an obfuscated C contest, which

1054
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,570
is for real geeks who write
code that no one else can read,

1055
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:42,050
but that does something either
really simple or really amazing.

1056
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:43,890
And we thought we'd
conclude with this look

1057
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:48,300
at something that's pretty amazing
you might have seen once before.

1058
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,650
But we'll end on this
note, dot slash, thadgavin.

1059
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:53,860
This then is what awaits.

1060
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:57,140

1061
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,500
>> That's it for CS50.

1062
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,935
We will see you on Wednesday.

1063
00:48:59,935 --> 00:49:04,284

1064
00:49:04,284 --> 00:49:10,016
>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

1065
00:49:10,016 --> 00:53:31,883
