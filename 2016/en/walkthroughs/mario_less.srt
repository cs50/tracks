1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
ZAMYLA CHAN: It's a me, Zamyla.

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,910
Today in Mario, we're going to be
drawing the half pyramid for Mario

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,290
to climb up.

5
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,570
>> So let's talk about our
to-do's for this problem.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,610
We're going to want
to prompt and validate

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,290
the user for a valid input of how
high they want Mario's pyramid to be.

8
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,090
And then, we're going to draw it.

9
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,870
So let's get started with prompting and
validating the user for their input.

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,640
>> We can make use of the
CS50 Library Function

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,160
get int that will ensure that
the user inputs an integer.

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,730
Any positive integers, negative
integers, number 0 are all fair game.

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,670
Otherwise, the user will be prompted to
retry until they input a valid integer.

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,210
Now although get int does
a lot of the work for us

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,730
in ensuring that the
user gives us an integer,

16
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,760
we still need to apply some
additional constraints on that.

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,420
After all, we can't have Mario climbing
a half pyramid of height negative 12.

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,040
>> In addition to that, the
problem specification

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,490
says that we can only
allow Mario to climb

20
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,940
a pyramid of heights between 0 and 23.

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,120
OK, so that means that we need
to continuously prompt the user

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,320
to give us a valid
number and only continue

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,120
once they've given us a valid height.

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,720
How do we do that?

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,760
>> Well, continuous processes give us
the idea of loops-- doing something

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,720
repetitively.

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,220
One loop in C as a while
loop that will continuously

28
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,480
execute the body of the loop as long as
the given condition evaluates to true.

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,200
As soon as that condition
evaluates to false,

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,770
the program will proceed to
whatever comes after that.

31
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,180
So while loops are one way of
ensuring that we continually

32
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,320
prompt the user for a valid input.

33
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,070
And once they give us a valid input,
we'll proceed to whatever comes next.

34
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,380
We know that we're going to ask
the user for input at least once.

35
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,200
So now we come to a sister of the
while loop, which is the do while loop.

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,650
>> Do while loops will execute the
body of the loop at least once.

37
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,150
So without checking the condition,
it will execute the body of the loop.

38
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,750
And then check the condition to see
whether it needs to repeat itself.

39
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,080
This comes in handy when
we're validating user input.

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,830
We know that we're going
to ask them at least once.

41
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,780
So a do while loop might
look something like this.

42
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,090
We have an integer n.

43
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,760
And inside of the do
while loop, we immediately

44
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,750
prompt the user for an integer.

45
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,740
If n is invalid, then we'll prompt them
again and again and again until they

46
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,820
give us that valid integer.

47
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,440
Finally, once n is a valid input, we'll
proceed to the rest of our program.

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,830
>> So let's go back to the spec and check
what the conditions for a valid input

49
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,670
is going to be.

50
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,090
The valid heights are going to
be between 0 and 23, inclusive.

51
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,350
So invalid heights are going to
be less than 0 or more than 23.

52
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,420
So remember to design
your condition carefully,

53
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,660
knowing that the condition
for the do while loop

54
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,470
should be while n is invalid.

55
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,080
Now this isn't going to be a
simple single Boolean expression.

56
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,630
We're going to have to combine
two different expressions

57
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,900
to make our whole condition.

58
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,290
>> So let's just look at a truth table I've
already given you the hint that we're

59
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,200
going to be dealing with two Booleans.

60
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,620
So here's a truth table where I
have two Booleans-- Boolean 1 and 2.

61
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:27,050
So we have the option to evaluate
bool1 and bool2 or bool1 or bool2.

62
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,980
And will only be true if both
Booleans evaluate to true, whereas all

63
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,280
or will be true as long as one of
the two Booleans evaluates to true.

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,450
OK, so take a moment, pause this
video and digest this truth table.

65
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,930
I'll be right here waiting.

66
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,760
When you come back, see
if you can piece together

67
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,910
a Boolean expression for your
condition of n being an invalid input.

68
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,420
>> So now that we have
valid user input, let's

69
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,710
go ahead and talk about how we
might draw the half pyramid.

70
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,410
Here in this simple text editor,
I've drawn a left aligned pyramid.

71
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,050
But we know that we need our
pyramid to be right aligned.

72
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,650
So how might I do this?

73
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,440
Well, I might try to push
everything to the side

74
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,880
by just putting a little
character in between.

75
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,779
And then, for the next
line, I'm going to put

76
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:20,970
some more characters to push it along,
and further-- so on and so forth--

77
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,360
until I have the right aligned pyramid.

78
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,780
So we do have a right align pyramid, but
it doesn't look so great with the dots.

79
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,680
But we still want to
maintain that nice spacing.

80
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,260
So I'm going to literally
insert some spaces.

81
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,420
>> Instead of three dots, I'll
put one, two, three spaces.

82
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,370
On the second line.

83
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,640
I'll put one, two spaces.

84
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,370
And on the penultimate
line, just one space.

85
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,290
And here I have a right aligned pyramid.

86
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,170
From doing the example in the text
editor, we have an idea for the pattern

87
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,590
that we'll use to draw the half pyramid.

88
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,080
For every row, what we did
is we type some spaces,

89
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,170
and then typed some
hashes, and then typed

90
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,020
the Enter key, which
is creating a new line.

91
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,770
So now that we have that, let's go
one step further and find a pattern.

92
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,170
>> So I'm going to say, for the
interest of this example,

93
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,480
we're dealing with a height of 8.

94
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,100
The first row is going to have two
hashes that follows seven spaces.

95
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,020
The second-- three hashes, six spaces.

96
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,260
Third row-- four hashes, five
spaces-- so on and so forth

97
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,350
until we get to the NTH row.

98
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,540
So then, I ask you for the NTH row,
how many hashes are we going to have

99
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,120
and how many spaces?

100
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,000
So it's up to you to figure out a
formula to represent how many hashes

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,020
and how many spaces are needed for
the NTH row when you have some height.

102
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,060
>> Now when you're figuring this out,
be careful how you're indexing.

103
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,170
What I mean by this is that
in everyday life all of us

104
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,540
start counting, usually by 1.

105
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,950
But in CS50 and in computer science
in general, we are 0 indexed.

106
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,620
So the first row would be
n of 0 as opposed to 1.

107
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,550
Be careful of this when you're
trying to figure out your pattern.

108
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,570
So now let's go back to how
we're going to draw our pyramid.

109
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,300
For every row, we're going to want to
print the spaces, print the hashes,

110
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,050
and then print a new line.

111
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,160
The hint here is the
word "for" every row.

112
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,470
In C, we have a construct
called a for loop,

113
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,250
which is comprised of an
initialization, a condition, an update,

114
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,790
and the body of the loop.

115
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:31,360
>> Say I wanted to say, hello
world, 50 times, my for loop

116
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,880
would look something like this.

117
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,480
I initialize my integer to 0.

118
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,230
The condition is that I is less than 50.

119
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,350
And then my update is just
incrementing I by one every time.

120
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,140
We can also use for loops
to iterate over things.

121
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,820
Notice here how we haven't
hard coded a number,

122
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,820
but rather placed the variable
height instead into the condition.

123
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,420
So what I'm doing here is I'm iterating
over every row of the pyramid.

124
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,160
I can do something for each
row inside the body of my loop.

125
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,350
>> What are we doing inside
the body of the loop?

126
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,120
Well, as we already said, we're printing
spaces and we're printing hashes

127
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,480
and we're printing a new line.

128
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,950
So my outer for loop
will look like this.

129
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,070
I iterate over every row
of the pyramid, using,

130
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,890
in this case, height as the variable
that stores the height of the pyramid.

131
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,870
Inside the body of that loop, I'm
going to print spaces repeatedly, print

132
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,730
the hashes repeatedly,
and then print a new line.

133
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:31,010
>> So now, using all of the concepts that
I've talked about in this walk-through,

134
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,210
you should be able to prompt the
user for input, validate that input,

135
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,370
and then draw the half pyramid.

136
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,510
>> My name is Zamyla, and this is CS50.

137
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,167
