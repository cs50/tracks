ZAMYLA CHAN: In the
initials problem, we're

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,650
going to prompt the user for their
name and then print their initials.

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,010
To prompt for the name, we'll use the
get string function found in the CS 50

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,090
library, and you're allowed to
assume that this string will only

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,490
contain letters and spaces-- so no
numbers and no other characters.

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,250
Then, once you have the
string, you'll iterate through.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,520
>> If, say, I was using
this program, then I

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,790
might type my name perfectly--
Zamyla Chan with a capital Z

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,510
in the beginning, a space, and then
a capital C to start my last name.

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,830
So you'd simply iterate
through the string,

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,320
getting the first character, and then
the first character after a space

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,120
and printing those out.

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,800
>> But say you had a slightly
sloppier user, Milo Banana, who

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,420
doesn't type in uppercase and
might include some extraneous space

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,380
characters.

17
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,752
Well, then when you
iterate through the string,

18
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:51,710
you'll have to check to make sure
that you're not printing out a space,

19
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,650
but rather, his proper
initials, capital M,

20
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:59,330
capital B. To print out capital letters,
you can use the toupper function.

21
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,710
And with that, you finished the problem.

22
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,119
>> My name is Z. C., and this was initials.

23
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,521
