1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,960
SPEAKER 1: Let's talk about water.

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:07,280
In this problem, we ask the user to tell
us how long in minutes their shower was

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,040
and then we calculate the equivalent
number of bottles of water

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,970
that their shower used.

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,379
>> So what are our to-do's
for this problem?

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,050
First, we're going to want
to prompt and then validate

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,100
the input that the user gives us.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,790
Once we ensure that we
have valid user input,

10
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,230
we're going to calculate the
equivalent number of bottles of water

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,770
that the user had during
their shower, and then we're

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,720
going to tell them by
printing out that number.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,230
>> So let's tackle our first
task, prompting and validating

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,550
the user input.

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,910
For this we've written a
function for you called

16
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,950
get_int located in the CS50 Library.

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,710
get_int ensures that the user inputs
an integer, so any positive numbers,

18
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,700
negative numbers, or
zero are all accepted.

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,900
But if the user inputs anything else,
so any combination of letters or numbers

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,710
or decimal numbers, then the
user will be prompted to retry

21
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,319
and the function won't accept anything
until the user gives them an integer.

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,410
>> So how do we use get_int?

23
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,830
If you open your workspace and
create a file named integer.c let's

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,110
type the following.

25
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,760
Hashtag include cs50.h.

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,480
This is necessary because get_int
is a cs50 library function,

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,890
so we must hashtag include
its declaration in order

28
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,370
to use the function.

29
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,570
And then in my main
function I'm just going

30
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,560
to simply call the function get_int.

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,750
>> So let's run this and see how it works.

32
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,092
I've already compiled it, so let's
just go ahead and run this program,

33
00:01:35,092 --> 00:01:36,480
./integer.

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,880
Here I have a prompt and
here's where I input the value.

35
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,880
Say I put in just some integer,
50, the program excepts and quits

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,960
and that's that.

37
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,350
>> But say I run it again and
I input something else.

38
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,350
Perhaps, hello world.

39
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,660
That's not an integer so the
program will prompt me to retry.

40
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,160
Let's try again with
perhaps a decimal this time.

41
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,450
0.5, again, not an integer so
the program won't accept it

42
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,290
and it'll tell me to retry.

43
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,070
So let's give it another number.

44
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,830
The program accepts it,
quits, and we're done.

45
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,520
>> So now we have a function
that allows us and ensures

46
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,790
that the user inputs an
integer, but how can we

47
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,330
actually keep track of the
integer inputted by the user?

48
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,260
Well, all we'll do is store
this value in a variable, say n.

49
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,580
So if I declare an integer n,
and I set that value to get_int,

50
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,700
then n will then store whatever
value the user inputted.

51
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,620
>> All right, so now we've ensured that
the user will give us an integer

52
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,550
and we know how to keep track
of the integer, but remember,

53
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,610
integers are both positive and negative.

54
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,110
So it doesn't really make sense
in the context of this problem

55
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,570
that the user takes a shower
of say negative 12 minutes.

56
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:59,310
So we need to make sure that the user
actually gives us a positive integer.

57
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,130
Now we don't have just a
single function for that,

58
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,620
so we're going to have
to create that ourselves.

59
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,190
>> So we want to continually
prompt the user

60
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,730
until they give us a positive integer.

61
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,300
If I'm doing something continuously then
that's akin to a loop, a repetition.

62
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,130
So one of the constructs that we use
in c to implement repetition and loops

63
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,410
is a while loop.

64
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,020
So a while loop, as
shown here, will execute

65
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,030
whatever is in the body of the loop as
long as the given condition evaluates

66
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,900
to true.

67
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,640
As soon as that condition
evaluates to false, then

68
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,830
the program will proceed to whatever
comes after the body of the loop.

69
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,400
>> So while loops are going to
be really useful in CS50.

70
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,590
But in this particular
case, we know that we're

71
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:48,140
going to prompt the user at least
once and then only loop if necessary.

72
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,080
So here we come to a
special construct and that's

73
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,020
very similar to the while
loop called a do-while loop.

74
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,840
>> So a do-while loop executes the
body of the loop at least once

75
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,750
and then it checks to see
whether it should execute,

76
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,310
as opposed to a while loop,
which will check the condition

77
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,200
and then execute the body.

78
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,880
So in a do-while loop what we might
do is prompt the user for an integer,

79
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,450
and then check if it's invalid or not.

80
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,130
If it's invalid, then we'll
repeat the process asking the user

81
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,290
to give us another integer, and then
only when that integer is valid,

82
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,060
we'll continue to
whatever comes afterwards.

83
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,030
>> Now you'll notice that the
declaration of the integer n

84
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,670
is slightly different to what we
did before in the previous example

85
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,640
and this is because of scope.

86
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,920
If we had declared the integer n inside
of the body of the do-while loop,

87
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,640
then we wouldn't be able to access
that value of n outside of those curly

88
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,050
braces indicating the body of the loop.

89
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:51,080
But we do in fact want to access the
value of n later on in our program.

90
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,730
>> OK, so now let's talk about
what this condition should be.

91
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,400
We want to only reprompt the
user as long as n is invalid.

92
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,640
So think to yourself what an invalid
integer value would look like

93
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,060
and then create a Boolean
expression to express that.

94
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,070
>> We're almost finished with our subtask
of prompting and validating user input.

95
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,010
So let's make this a little
bit more user friendly

96
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,390
and give the user a little
bit more information

97
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,510
of what we're prompting them for.

98
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,500
So let's prompt the user, per the
spec, with the string minutes.

99
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,935
So using your printf statements, make
sure that you match this exactly.

100
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:30,230
>> All right.

101
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,840
So now we have a valid user
input, a positive integer

102
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,400
value for how many minutes
they spent in the shower.

103
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,300
So what's next is to calculate
the equivalent number of bottles.

104
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,250
What we're going to do here might
be very obvious to you at first,

105
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,640
and that's OK.

106
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,320
What we want to do is we
want to start practicing

107
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,810
the idea of detecting patterns and
developing formulae for the problem.

108
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,200
>> So we're told per the spec
that one minute in the shower

109
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,960
is equivalent to about
12 bottles of water.

110
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,020
So then two minutes would
be equivalent to 24,

111
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,850
and five minutes would
be equivalent to 60.

112
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,390
So now if you think
you've got it, then let's

113
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,390
see if you can come up
with a pattern or formula

114
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,990
to express if we have say, n
minutes, how many bottles of water

115
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,930
would that be expressed in terms of n?

116
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,680
>> Again, even though this
might be simple at first,

117
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,240
later on when we get to
more complicated problems

118
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,360
we're going to want to get into
the practice of identifying

119
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,120
patterns and developing formulae
to figure these things out.

120
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,450
>> In c you have access to
standard arithmetic operations,

121
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,520
addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division.

122
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,420
So I'll leave it to
you now to figure out

123
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,300
how to express the
equivalent number of bottles

124
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,990
that the user consumed
during their shower.

125
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,700
>> All right, we're almost done.

126
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,650
We've prompted the user for their input,
we've ensured that it's valid input,

127
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,330
and then we've figured out how
to calculate the equivalent

128
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,480
number of bottles that they consumed.

129
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,430
So the last thing to do is to output
the equivalent number of bottles

130
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,410
and hopefully encourage
them to conserve some water.

131
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,270
>> Outputting the value will
be a printf statement.

132
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,720
If I wanted to tell you that I
have three pets, for instance,

133
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,090
I might use a printf statement
that looks something like this.

134
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,880
I have three pets, and a new
line for nice formatting.

135
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
>> Now we don't want to
simply hard code things.

136
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,740
Say the number of my
pets changes over time.

137
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,080
Then I'm going to make use of
placeholders in my printf statement.

138
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,350
So here my number is an integer.

139
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,480
So I'm going to make a placeholder
for an integer using %i.

140
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,930
I'm going to write the string,
and then after the string

141
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,000
I write a comma and then the
variable that I want to print.

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,730
So that value will be printed
in lieu of that placeholder, %i.

143
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,630
>> You can use placeholders, as
well, for floats with a %f.

144
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,420
You can also have multiple
placeholders in a string.

145
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,950
For instance, if I have some number
of dogs and some number of cats,

146
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:59,210
I put two placeholders here and then
my two variables in respective order.

147
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,130
>> So now that we know how to print
the values stored in variables,

148
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,030
the very last thing to
do is to ensure that we

149
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,920
print the value in the exact format
indicated in the specification.

150
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,990
With that, we've prompted the
user and validated their input.

151
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,920
We've then calculated the equivalent
number of bottles of water

152
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,100
that they consume during their shower,
and we've outputted that value to them.

153
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,440
And so, we've completed water.

154
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,730
>> My name is [? Zamila, ?]
and this is CS50.

155
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,909
