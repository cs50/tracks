1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,930

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,030
>> Zamyla Chan: Let's step up our
game with the vigenere cipher.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,710
The vigenere cipher is
very similar to Caesar,

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,060
except in Caesar we passed in
a single integer as our key.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,100
In vigenere we're going
to pass in a keyword.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,400
So, if I wanted to shift the
ciphertext this is CS 50 by ohai,

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,260
then that means that each letter in
ohai is going to serve as the key,

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,160
and I'm going to cycle over
that keyword for my shift

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,930
making the ciphertext
a lot harder to decode.

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,540
>> What does it mean to
shift by the keyword?

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,610
Well, the keyword is a string
where every letter corresponds

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,080
to some integer shift.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:49,310
So, the o corresponds to a key of 14,
h to a key of 7, a has a key of 0,

14
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:54,670
so that wouldn't change anything,
and then i has a key of 8.

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:00,000
>> Say I ran vigenere A with the
plain text this is CS50 well,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,800
that would simply give
me an unchanged string.

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,170
Notice that this is equivalent to
running Caesar with a key of zero.

18
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,070
In fact, running vigenere
with any single character

19
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:17,070
would be equivalent to running
Caesar with that same integer.

20
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,400
>> All right, so, since
they are so similar I'd

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,300
actually recommend that if you
want you can just copy your Caesar

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,932
code into your vigenere code.

23
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:28,640
Things will change,
but at least you have

24
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,110
some backbone that you can work with.

25
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,410
Because the TODOs are the same we want
to get the key, get the plain text,

26
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,690
encipher that plain text,
and then print that out.

27
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,980
>> Just like Caesar the key is going to
be passed in as the second command line

28
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:50,540
argument contained in argv index
1, but it's different this time

29
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,560
because it must be alphabetical.

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,390
So, we need to iterate over every
single character in that key

31
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,800
that the user passed in, and ensure
that every character is alphabetic

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
in order to continue.

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,560
>> Once we've done that, then we
can get the string from the user,

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,560
just as we did before.

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,520
And now, we come to the heart
of the problem for vigenere,

36
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,665
which is just like Caesar, how to
figure out the enciphering pattern

37
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:19,760
and equation, and encipher
the entire plaintext.

38
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,280
>> So, you'll notice that the
equation for the vigenere shift

39
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,610
is very similar to the Caesar one.

40
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,780
The only difference is that
instead of a single variable k

41
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:37,270
before, now k has a subscript,
indicating the jth letter of the key.

42
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,560
>> Let's walk through an example.

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,830
Say you wanted to pass a secret
message onto your crush, I like you.

44
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,325
Well, for your key you
choose something that your

45
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:49,790
know crush knows that you like, pandas.

46
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,290
All right, so how do we shift this?

47
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,500
>> Well, we have our plaintext index.

48
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,160
That's at the first letter and
so is the index for our key

49
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,830
which is at the p, the first
letter in our panda word.

50
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:08,590
So, shifting I by p gives us x,
then we advance the plaintext index.

51
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,460
This gets us to a space.

52
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,540
Now, the space character
is non alphabetic,

53
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,930
so that means that, that just
transfers right over to the ciphertext,

54
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:23,430
we put a space there, and we don't
advance the index for our key.

55
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,820
So, we're still at p at this point.

56
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,130
>> We advance to the next
index in our plaintext.

57
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,030
And now, because that is
a letter, the lowercase l,

58
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,920
we shift that by the
next index in our key.

59
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,360
Which is a, which is a zero
shift so that just becomes

60
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,370
an l in our ciphertext.

61
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:51,120
Then, we advance both the plaintext, and
the key index because it's alphabetic.

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,210
So then we continue that
until we get to the e in like.

63
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:01,090
>> All right, so you'll notice at this
point that, in terms of our key index,

64
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,940
we've reached the end of
the panda word, so what

65
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,750
happens when we get to the next
alphabetic letter in the plaintext?

66
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,180
Well, all that happens is we
wrap around to the beginning,

67
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,710
to the first index of our key.

68
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,570
So, then we shift that
y by p to give us n.

69
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:26,860
And then, we continue finishing encoding
our plaintext to get x lvne noh.

70
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,300
>> From this example, I
showed that we only advance

71
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,140
to the next letter in the keyword
if the character in plain text

72
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,480
is a letter so the isalpha
function will come in handy here.

73
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:43,030
And, just as in Caesar, we want to
preserve the case, isupper and islower.

74
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,100
So, add this little bit
in into your pseudocode.

75
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,510
>> So how do we figure out the key shifts?

76
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:53,030
Well, if you recall our discussion
on alphabetical indices in the Caesar

77
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,370
problem, it's very similar.

78
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,130
>> Where A corresponds to an ASCII
value of 65 but a shift of 0,

79
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,550
and then the last letter
in the alphabet, Z,

80
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,940
corresponds to a shift of 25.

81
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,320
You'll notice that the shift
is identical whether or not

82
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,880
the letter is upper case or lower case.

83
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,700
>> OK, so now that you
know how to figure out

84
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,470
the numerical shift that
corresponds to a single character

85
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,050
let's go back to our equation.

86
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,180
Because we have two different
subscripts here, i and j,

87
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,130
that's a hint that we want to keep track
of both our position in the plaintext

88
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,600
as well as our position in the keyword,
so those are two separate variables

89
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,010
that we want to keep a hold of.

90
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,580
>> Now, the position in our plaintext
is going to increase every time,

91
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,530
so that's going to be a
bit more straight forward

92
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,750
as opposed to the position the keyword,
which we know has to wrap around,

93
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,910
and sometimes increment,
sometimes stay the same.

94
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,430
So, how do we implement
the functionality

95
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,820
to wrap around the
index for the keyword?

96
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,640
>> I'm going to use the count off example.

97
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,100
Counting off is a popular way
to split people into groups.

98
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,660
Say I had 5 people and I wanted to
split them up into three groups,

99
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,640
well then I would start by counting off.

100
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,980
The first person would
say I'm team number one,

101
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,030
the next person would be team number
two, the third person team number

102
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:21,910
three.

103
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,910
Now, I only want three groups so
the fourth person would actually

104
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,160
start at the beginning and say,
well, I'm team number one as well,

105
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,890
and the next person
would be team number two.

106
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:37,660
And, from there, they can then
separate into their groups.

107
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,130
>> So, how might I use modulo
to help me implement

108
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,160
this count off wrap around function?

109
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,140
Well, the first person
number 1, mod 3 gives us 1.

110
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,690
2 mod 3 gives us 2,
and 3 mod 3 gives us 0.

111
00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:02,140
>> The fourth person, number 4, mod 3
gives us 1, and then 5 mod 3 gives us 2.

112
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,370
So, you will notice that even though
the number of people that I have

113
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:11,210
increases, and is above
3, since I'm modding by 3

114
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,250
I always get numbers 0, 1, and 2.

115
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,040
I never get larger than 3.

116
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,630
So then, even if I had 10
people, then all of those people

117
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,430
would still be within groups 1, 2, or 0.

118
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:33,560
>> So, now we know that if we have a group
of 5 and we mod all of those by 3,

119
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,180
then we're never going to
exceed groups 0, 1, or 2.

120
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,430
So, we're never going to get a group
number that's equal to 3 or above.

121
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,980
So, even if I add five more
people, then all of them

122
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:53,150
would still be assigned to groups
0, 1, or 2 because I'm modding by 3.

123
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,510
I'm never going to exceed that cap.

124
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,800
>> OK, so let's see if we can apply
this concept of using modulo

125
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,710
to wrap around the
group numbers and apply

126
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:08,000
it to vigenere where we want
to use modulo to wrap around

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,220
the index for the keyword.

128
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,830
Even though we're incrementing
the index we always

129
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,260
want to make sure that we always
wrap around to the very beginning

130
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,050
never exceeding the
length of the string.

131
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,510
>> OK, so I know it might be
a little bit overwhelming.

132
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,670
There's a lot more to do in this p set.

133
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,050
So, make sure that you write out
a good pseudocode for yourself

134
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,870
that you understand and
that gets the job done.

135
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,580
Try and address every
single line independently

136
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,370
figuring out all the little
small pieces of the puzzle

137
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,260
before putting it together.

138
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,110
>> Make sure that you can get
the key from the command line

139
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,780
and ensure that it's alphabetic,
get the plain text from the user,

140
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,010
and then in enciphering, make sure you
know how to encipher a single letter,

141
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:56,130
and then progress to the whole string
with all of the wrap around functions.

142
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,610
Finally, you can print the ciphertext.

143
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,050
>> My name is a Zamyla,
and this was vigenere.

144
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,757
