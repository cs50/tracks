1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,270
>> AMILA: Let's tackle Caesar.

3
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,110
In Caesar, we allow the user
to encode a secret message.

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,780
So let's dive right in and look
at our to-dos for this problem.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,210
So first, we get the key from the user.

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,210
Then we get the plaintext
that they want to encode.

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,380
After that, we encipher it for them,
and finally we print their ciphertext.

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,600
>> So let's start with an example.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,920
Say you wanted to encode the
entire alphabet with a key of two.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,360
Well, your entire alphabet would
just be shifted to letters.

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,060
So A would encode to C, B to
D, C to E, so on and so forth,

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:42,470
until you get to X, which encodes to Z
or zed, depending on where you're from.

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,445
Then Y would then shift all the way,
wrap around the alphabet to get to A,

14
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:53,256
and then finally the last letter of the
alphabet, Z, zed, would encode to B.

15
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:54,660
>> You got that?

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,380
Let's look at some examples.

17
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,540
The first example here is very similar
to what we just explained above.

18
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,560
So if I encode some section of the
alphabet, A through L, by a key of two,

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,760
then I just get my entire
alphabet shifted two letters.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,230
>> Then, in my next example,
the key is still two,

21
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,080
so you should still know
which letters to expect.

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,400
But here it's a phrase.

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,100
This is CS50.

24
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,090
So you'll notice that I
preserve the case of my letters,

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,600
so any upper case letters are also
upper case letters in the ciphertext.

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,800
And any lowercase
letters in the plaintext

27
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,640
are also lowercase
letters in the ciphertext.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,020
But I keep the letters
and any exclamation marks

29
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,610
or any other punctuation the same.

30
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,360
>> So now that we have a sense
for how the program works,

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,890
feel free to go run some more
examples of your own, if you wish.

32
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,072
Let's start with getting
the key from the user.

33
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:48,780
Traditionally, with
other problems, we've

34
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,450
been accustomed to getting
any numbers that we

35
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,710
need by prompting the user
with the function getint.

36
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,850
But this time we're actually going
to use the command line argument

37
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,760
and a new function called atoi.

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,130
>> When you run the main
program in C, then it

39
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,500
takes in two parameters--
int argc, which

40
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,670
is the number of arguments
passed in, and then

41
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,920
argv, an array of strings which contains
the list of all of the arguments

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,740
passed.

43
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,740
You don't explicitly have
to declare these variables.

44
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,700
They're computed for
you by the compiler.

45
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,160
Correct usage for this would be
for argc to be two in this case,

46
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,630
because the user has to pass in
the call to the program, ./caesar,

47
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,570
and then the key,
whatever number they wish.

48
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,920
So that means that argc must be two
in order for a valid use of Caesar

49
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,680
to be executed.

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,590
>> So let's look at an example.

51
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,760
Say I've already written and
compiled a program called blastoff.

52
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,670
So if I ran in the command line
./blastoff Team Rocket, well, then,

53
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,750
argc would be three because I
passed in three distinct arguments.

54
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,830
Then argv would look like this.

55
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,750
It's an array, and it would
contain each of the three strings.

56
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,640
./blastoff in the first index, team
in the next, and rocket in the last.

57
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,610
>> Let's talk about arrays for a sec.

58
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,560
Arrays are data structures that hold
multiple values of the same type.

59
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,980
This can come in handy when we
have lists of integers or strings.

60
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,030
Just remember they have
to be the same type.

61
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,310
In computer science, we
love counting from zero,

62
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,260
so remember that arrays
are also zero-indexed.

63
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,360
So the first element of my array
is going to be at index zero.

64
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,580
So in this case, when I have
an array of length four,

65
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,350
then the last index of the
last element of my array

66
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,970
is actually going to be
at index three, not four.

67
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,880
Because remember, we
start counting at zero.

68
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,530
>> Here's an example of how you
might create an array of your own.

69
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,440
So say I wanted to store my
three favorite dog names.

70
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,030
Then I would create an array of strings.

71
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,450
So I would declare the type, string, and
then put the name of the array, dogs,

72
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,450
and then in those square
brackets put the size

73
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,260
of the array-- in this case, three.

74
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,690
>> So my first entry is going
to be dogs at index zero,

75
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,750
and that's going to be Milo.

76
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,850
Then dogs at index one
is going to be goofy,

77
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,060
darling Mochi, and then the last
entry, the third entry at index two,

78
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,130
is going to be cute, sweet Elphie.

79
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,610
You'll notice that the format
for filling in this array

80
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,150
is very much like how you might
declare any other variable where

81
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,307
you have the variable name followed by
the value that you want stored in it.

82
00:04:36,307 --> 00:04:38,140
The only difference in
this case is that you

83
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,700
have to remember to put the index
of the value in square brackets.

84
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,420
And there we have our
three favorite dogs.

85
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,780
>> But alas, it's time
to get back to Caesar.

86
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,910
Remember that correct usage for the
user is going to be passing in not only

87
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,430
the name of the program ./caesar, but
also the key that they want to shift

88
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,850
their plaintext by.

89
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,540
So that means that argc must be two.

90
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:07,580
They must pass in two-- no more, no
less than two command line arguments.

91
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,050
>> Now, what about argv?

92
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,880
Well, we already know that the
array is going to be of length two,

93
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,270
but what's contained in each element?

94
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,330
Well, the first element
is going to be ./caesar,

95
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,190
and then the next element is going to
contain the key that the user typed in.

96
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,480
Now, if they used it correctly
for the usage of Caesar,

97
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,350
then they're going to type in a number.

98
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,260
But even though the character
that they type is a number,

99
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,790
it's of data type string.

100
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,390
>> So how do we convert that
string to an integer?

101
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:46,680
So say I have num, a string,
containing the string 50.

102
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,000
If I want to convert that
to an integer, then I simply

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,340
declare a new variable, an
integer i, calling atoi.

104
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:01,160
I pass in my string variable, num, and
then i will then contain the number 50.

105
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,350
Make sure to check the man
pages for the atoi function

106
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,990
to check which library it's
in, as well as what value it

107
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:14,550
will return if the string passed
in doesn't contain all numbers.

108
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,950
>> So now that we've gotten
the key, the next step

109
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,430
is to get the plaintext from the user.

110
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,170
Now, this is going to
be less complicated

111
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,410
than navigating around the
command line arguments.

112
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,190
All we have to do is call
the getstring function

113
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,660
to prompt the user to give
us a string, but remember

114
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,090
to check the specifications for how we
might want to prompt the user for that.

115
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,420
>> Now we come to the
heart of the problem--

116
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,860
how to encipher the plaintext.

117
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,830
Well, first, let's talk about how
to encipher one character at a time,

118
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,370
and then we'll address how to
iterate over the entire plaintext.

119
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,440
I've written some pseudocode
for the Caesar problem.

120
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,310
I encourage you to
write your own as well.

121
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,900
It might not look identical to
mine, and that's OK, but as long

122
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,640
as the general idea is the same.

123
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,780
>> The first three steps
we've already done.

124
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,100
We've gotten the key from
the command line argument,

125
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,510
we've turned that key
into an integer, and we've

126
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,320
prompted the user for the plaintext
that they want to encipher.

127
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,420
So then the next big chunk
is that for each character

128
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,070
in the plaintext string,
if it's alphabetic,

129
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,750
we want to preserve
its case and shift it.

130
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,900
By preserve case, what I
mean is that all upper case

131
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,580
letters should remain upper
case and all lowercase letters

132
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,640
should remain lowercase.

133
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,110
So then after we shift those,
then we print the ciphertext.

134
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,100
>> Here are three functions that are going
to come in handy for this problem.

135
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,010
Remember up above when I gave the
example for shifting this is CS50?

136
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,800
Remember that the 50 and the
exclamation mark didn't shift?

137
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,680
So how can we tell whether we
need to shift a letter or not?

138
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,650
Well, "is alpha," if
you pass it a character,

139
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:54,850
will return true if that character
is a letter and false otherwise.

140
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,870
To help you with
preserving capitalization

141
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,750
are the functions "is
upper" and "is lower."

142
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,350
>> These two functions also take
in a single character as input

143
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,580
and return you a Boolean,
either true or false

144
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,280
depending on whether that character
is upper case or lower case.

145
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,610
Because "is upper" and "is
lower" are Boolean functions,

146
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,660
meaning that they return you a Boolean,
you can use these in your conditions.

147
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,490
So here's a snippet of code that only
prints a letter if it's upper case.

148
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,790
So I've declared my character
letter to be the upper case zed

149
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:33,440
and then if "is upper" returns
true, then I print that letter.

150
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,200
>> Going back to our simple example of
shifting the alphabet by a key of two,

151
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,049
how do we actually get that to work?

152
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,770
Well, it turns out that characters
and integers are very closely related.

153
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,840
Each character has an
integer value associated

154
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,260
with it found in the ASCII chart,
where each character's ASCII

155
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,380
value is displayed.

156
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,940
So an upper case A corresponds
to an ASCII value of 65

157
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,270
and a lowercase a to
an ASCII value of 97.

158
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,940
>> Feel free to look up
any ASCII chart online

159
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,720
to see these values for yourself.

160
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,096
So what this means is that we can
take the character of upper case A,

161
00:09:12,096 --> 00:09:18,200
add the integer two to it, and then get
the character upper case C as a result.

162
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,720
That's because 65, the ASCII
value for capital A, plus 2,

163
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,960
gives us 67, which corresponds
to the character of upper case C.

164
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,480
>> Unfortunately, things
won't quite be so simple.

165
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,980
We have an equation that
we have to consider.

166
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:43,590
Here it tells us that the ith ciphertext
letter corresponds to the ith plaintext

167
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:48,900
letter, plus the key--
all of that, modular 26.

168
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,810
Why is that the case?

169
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,430
Let's go back to our example from
before, where capital A, plus 2,

170
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,590
gives us capital C.

171
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,870
>> So applying the equation that
the specification gives us,

172
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,660
then let's take capital A
plus 2 and mod that by 26.

173
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,730
So capital A, when I put it in
those single quotation marks,

174
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,010
allows me to treat it as
an integer, so that allows

175
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,500
me to cast it to its ASCII value, 65.

176
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,080
65 plus 2 is 67.

177
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,210
67 mod 26 gives us 15,
but that doesn't really

178
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:32,590
make sense because we know that the
capital C ASCII value is 67, not 15.

179
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,580
So how do we reconcile that?

180
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,840
>> Well, here I'd like to posit the
notion of an alphabetical index.

181
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,010
So we've already talked about how
each character has its ASCII value,

182
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,810
but I'd like to say, well, let's
think about each character also having

183
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,230
an alphabetical index,
where A for instance,

184
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:58,800
as the first letter of the alphabet,
has an alphabetical index of zero.

185
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,070
So now let's apply the
same equation as before,

186
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,040
but using an alphabetical index.

187
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,810
>> So A is zero, as we've defined.

188
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:15,640
So then taking zero plus two, mod 26,
that's two, mod 26, which gives us two.

189
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,780
And well, in terms of
an alphabetical index,

190
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,930
C is the third letter in the
alphabet, so that would correspond

191
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,290
to an alphabetical index of two.

192
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,850
So it seems that using the
alphabetical index in this case

193
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,840
actually gives us the correct result.

194
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,020
>> So now let's check to
see if the equation works

195
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,210
with an alphabetical index.

196
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:42,540
Y's alphabetical index is 24 as the
second to last letter in the alphabet.

197
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,520
So then 24 plus our
key of two gives us 26.

198
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:54,750
26 mod 26 gives us 0, which, lucky for
us, is the alphabetical index for A.

199
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:59,100
So hopefully that's proof enough that
the alphabetical index method works.

200
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,180
If not, feel free to try out
some examples of your own.

201
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,030
>> In order to properly wrap around the
alphabet and apply the Caesar equation,

202
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,280
then we know that we need to
deal with alphabetical indices.

203
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,130
But we start with ASCII
values, and only then

204
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,530
do we then convert to
the alphabetical index.

205
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:23,970
From there, in order to print, we need
to deal with the ASCII values again.

206
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,350
So we need to figure out how to
go from ASCII to alphabetical

207
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,080
and from alphabetical to ASCII.

208
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,910
>> So I leave it to you to figure out
the pattern between a character

209
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,590
and its alphabetical
index and its ASCII value.

210
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,530
Now, remember that even though
this table right on the slide

211
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,630
shows the capital letters, we also
have to consider whether or not

212
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,915
a different pattern applies
for the lower case characters.

213
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:52,070

214
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,840
>> So now that we've figured out
how to shift a single character,

215
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:02,200
then all we have to do is scale that
up to go across the entire plaintext.

216
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,260
So the plaintext is a string.

217
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,210
Lucky for us, a string is really
just an array of characters,

218
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:12,150
so in order to access every character
of a string, all you have to do

219
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,270
is to use array notation.

220
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:20,270
Say I have a variable of type
string called "text='this is CS50.'"

221
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,730
>> Well, then, in order to
access each character,

222
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,880
all I have to do with
the variable text is

223
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,660
to say well, text at index zero, that
corresponds to capital T. Text at index

224
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,100
one corresponds to the lower case h.

225
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,110
Another useful function is
the string length function.

226
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,760
So passing in a string to
that function will return

227
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,610
an integer, the length of that string.

228
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,060
>> Now that we've talked about
all these different elements,

229
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,540
let's put them back together.

230
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,210
So return to either my pseudocode
code or your pseudocode

231
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,920
and go through and make sure that you
know how to do every single thing.

232
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,520
Getting the key using argc and argv,
turning the key into an integer, a

233
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,840
to i, prompting for plaintext,
getstring, and then iterating

234
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,590
over every character in
the plaintext string,

235
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:14,910
preserving the case of each character
and shifting that character by the key,

236
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,520
ensuring that you're
wrapping around the alphabet,

237
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,850
finally printing that ciphertext.

238
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,470
My name is Amila, and this was Caesar.

239
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,448
