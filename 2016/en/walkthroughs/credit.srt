1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,560
>> Zamyla Chan: Let's check your credit.

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,360
In this problem, we'll prompt the user
for an input of a credit card number.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,090
Then we'll run that credit card
number to see if it's valid.

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,430
If so, we'll print the company
that that credit card belongs to.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,520
Otherwise, we'll tell the user
that that card is invalid.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,210
>> Let's jump right in with
prompting for user input.

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,080
The credit card number is
of data type long_long,

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,190
so the CS50 library function
get_long_long will be quite useful.

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,690
But this function ensures that
the user inputs any integer.

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,730
So any positive integers, negative
integers, or zero is all fine.

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,560
So up to you to further
validate whether or not

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,770
the user has given us a valid
credit card type number.

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,560
>> Now that we have a credit card
number from the user, then

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,580
we need to calculate the checksum.

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,780
So credit card checksums
are calculated as follows.

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,370
Starting from the second to last digit,
we multiply every other digit by 2.

18
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,060
Then we add those
products' digits together.

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,140
From that we add the
sum of the digits that

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,780
weren't multiplied by 2 to that
previous sum that we calculated.

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,480
Finally, if that number ends
in 0, then the number is valid.

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,760
>> Let's go through an example
and take this step by step.

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,930
So our first step is to start
from the second to last digit

24
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,080
and multiply every other digit by two.

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,240
Now, if I stored the credit card
number in a variable called CC number,

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,060
then modding that by 10 would
give me the very last digit.

27
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,910
So how might you access
the second to last digit?

28
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,030
>> OK, so once we've accessed
the second to last digit,

29
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,790
then we'll iterate through
multiplying every other digit by 2.

30
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,620
Once we have that, then
we'll take those products

31
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,350
and add those products' digits together.

32
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,830
So here I have single
digits, so that's fine.

33
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,480
But then once I get to my last
number-- 7 multiplied by 2--

34
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,080
I add the 1 and the 4 to give me 27.

35
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,980
From there, we add that product--
27-- to the sum of the digits that

36
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,790
weren't multiplied by 2.

37
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,070
>> So here I've highlighted all
of those numbers in orange.

38
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,900
Once we add those digits, then
we get our final checksum number.

39
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,120
So we validate it by making
sure that the last digit is 0.

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,635
If the checksum does not end in
0, then the credit card number

41
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:14,400
is definitely invalid.

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,840
Otherwise, let's go on to
check the company identifiers

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,870
and the credit card number length.

44
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,830
>> We've provided a list
of three companies,

45
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,940
along with that, the number of integers
that their credit card numbers have.

46
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,630
Then the first two digits that
those cards might start with.

47
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,070
So up to you to keep track of the
first two digits of the credit card

48
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,620
and the number of integers in that card.

49
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,110
And with that, you've
finished the problem.

50
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,210
My name is Zamyla, and this was Credit.

51
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,859
