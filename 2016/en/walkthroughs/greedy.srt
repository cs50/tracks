1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,900
>> Let's get greedy.

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,810
In greedy, our job is to play
the role of a greedy cashier.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,750
The user will tell us how
much change we owe them,

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,520
and then our job is to calculate
the minimum number of coins

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,240
that we can use to make
that amount of change.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,560
>> Let's start with an example.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,170
Say the user requires $0.32 back.

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,960
We could do this by giving
them 32 pennies, one cent each.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,180
Or I could also use five coins-- by
giving them three dimes, $0.10 each,

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,060
and two pennies, $0.02 each.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,580
But could we use even
fewer coins to make that?

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,100
>> The whole tactic in greedy--
to be a greedy cashier--

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,600
is to use the largest coin possible.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,670
So whenever we have
quarters we'll use them.

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,100
And then once those run out,
we'll use dimes, $0.10 each.

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,840
Then nickels, 5 cents each, and
then down to pennies, one cent each.

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,792
By using the largest coin
possible whenever we can,

19
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:07,350
we ensure that we use the fewest number
of coins possible to make the change.

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,180
>> So let's walk this through.

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,660
The user needs $0.32.

22
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,200
So we ask ourselves,
can we use a quarter?

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,560
Well, yes we can.

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,720
So now we only know them
$0.07, and we used one coin.

25
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,970
>> Can we use another quarter?

26
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:21,890
Well, no.

27
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,570
$0.07 is less than $0.25, so we proceed
to the next largest coin available.

28
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,690
Dimes are $0.10, and
again, we can't use dimes.

29
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,480
Because dimes are worth $0.10, which
is more than the amount of change owed.

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,790
>> We go to nickels.

31
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,890
And, yes indeed, $0.05 is less than
$0.10-- so we can use a nickel.

32
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,104
So now we only owe the user $0.02,
and we've so far used two coins.

33
00:01:46,104 --> 00:01:47,270
We can't use another nickel.

34
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,140
So then we proceed to the last coin at
our disposal, which are the pennies.

35
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,270
>> And can we use penny?

36
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:59,060
Well, yes-- and we end up using two
pennies for a total of four coins.

37
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,430
>> Once you're finished, the
program will look like this.

38
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,710
Once the user runs the
greedy program, they'll

39
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,270
be prompted to give the amount of
change in dollars that they're owed.

40
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,140
And then your program will output
the minimum amount of coins

41
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,740
that the greedy cashier would use
to make that amount of change.

42
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,160
>> So now let's break this
down into our subtasks.

43
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,410
First we're going to prompt our
user for an amount of change.

44
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,630
And, as with any user input, we want to
make sure that we validate that input

45
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,360
and ensure that we can use that
input for the rest of our program.

46
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,480
Then we're going to always
use the largest point possible

47
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,240
and keep track of the coins used.

48
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,080
And finally, print the final
number of coins that we used.

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,970
>> So let's talk about prompting.

50
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,550
The amount must make cents,
and this is in dollars.

51
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,440
And so for dollars, we're going
to use the float variable type.

52
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,390
Now whenever you ask a user for input,
you want to make sure that it's valid.

53
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,640
And so here we like to take advantage
of the do-while loop construct.

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,320
>> A do-while loop will execute the
body of the loop at least once.

55
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,650
So this comes in handy.

56
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,510
We know that we need to prompt the
user at least once for a float.

57
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,100
Now if that float is valid.

58
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,710
That's great.

59
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,460
We move on.

60
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,910
But if not, the loop will ensure
that we get a proper float

61
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,810
by repeating continuously until
the user gives us a valid value.

62
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,760
>> Now for the do-while
loop condition, we need

63
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,000
to consider what it means
to have an invalid float.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,220
So for the context of
this problem, probably

65
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,450
it makes sense just to
accept positive values.

66
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,010
>> So moving on-- we've obtained a
value in dollars from the user.

67
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,380
But we're dealing with coins,
which are entirely in cents.

68
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,660
$1 is equivalent to 100 cents.

69
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,670
So a good thing to do is to
convert those values into cents.

70
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:48,380
>> Now when converting from a float
to an integer, so dollars to cents,

71
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,230
we want to make sure that we're careful
about floating-point imprecision.

72
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,260
So that means that-- say
my dollar value-- my float

73
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,260
value-- was an even $2, there still
may be some stray numbers in there.

74
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,590
So we want to make sure that not only
do we multiply by 100 to get the cents,

75
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,480
but we also round it off.

76
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,210
>> So now we have the amount
of change owed to the user.

77
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:13,430
We originally obtained it in dollars,
and now we've converted it to cents.

78
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,029
So now we can proceed with the heart of
the greedy algorithm, which is always

79
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,220
using the largest coin possible.

80
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,930
While we're doing this,
it's essential that we also

81
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,360
keep track of how many coins are
going to be returned to the user

82
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,630
as well as the remaining
change owed to the user.

83
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,130
>> The program will look
something like this.

84
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,190
After you get the amount of
dollars and convert that to cents,

85
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,790
then you'll enter a loop.

86
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,400
While quarters can be
used-- that is to say

87
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,660
while the amount of change owed to the
user is greater than or equal to $0.25,

88
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,040
you'll use a quarter.

89
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,000
>> Now what does using a quarter entail?

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,280
Well, one-- you'll increase the coin
count to be returned to the user.

91
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,890
And second you'll decrease the current
amount of change owed back to the user

92
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,520
by $0.25.

93
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,680
>> After repeating that until
quarters can no longer be used,

94
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,630
proceed to the next largest
coin-- in this case dimes, $0.10.

95
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,750
So you'll enter that loop until
you can no longer use dimes.

96
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,720
Then proceed to the next
largest coin, nickels.

97
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,810
After nickels can no longer be used,
use the remaining amount in pennies.

98
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,800
And finally, print the
number of coins used.

99
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,350
>> Another way that you can
approach the greedy problem

100
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,950
is to use the modulo approach.

101
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,690
Modulo is an operator
that returns the remainder

102
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,680
of the division between two numbers.

103
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,270
Say I had 50 mod 5.

104
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,070
Well, 5 is a factor of 50,
so the remainder will be 0.

105
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:39,230
50 mod 10-- well, 10 is also a factor
of 50, so the remainder is also 0.

106
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,660
50 mod 50-- well, any number mod itself
isn't going to have any remainder.

107
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,510
>> What about 50 mod 49?

108
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,910
Well, 49 only goes into 50 once.

109
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,290
So the remainder is going to be 1.

110
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:55,180
53 mod 50 is going to
give you a remainder of 3.

111
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,120
>> So how can we use modulo
and perhaps some division

112
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,690
to implement our greedy algorithm?

113
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,550
Well, we still want to stay true to the
heart of the greedy algorithm-- that

114
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,910
is using the largest coin possible.

115
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:14,570
>> So let's ask ourselves if we can use any
quarters to return $0.32 to the user.

116
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:20,070
Well, 32 mod 25 gives
us a remainder of $0.07.

117
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,500
So that tells us that we can definitely
use one quarter with $0.07 remaining.

118
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,180
>> Can we then use any dimes?

119
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:32,740
Well, no-- because $0.07 mod
$0.10 gives us a remainder of 7.

120
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,960
10 doesn't go into 7 at all.

121
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,390
>> Then can we use nickels?

122
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:40,490
Well $0.07 mod 5 cents
gives us two remaining.

123
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,930
And lastly, can we use any pennies?

124
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,930
2 mod 1 gives us 0,
which is ultimately what

125
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,160
we want because then that
means that we've returned

126
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
to the user all of the change owed.

127
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,320
>> So now you have two possible ways of
implementing the greedy algorithm--

128
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,230
one with loops and one with a
combination of modulo and division.

129
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,010
So finally, we just need to
print the final number of coins.

130
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,520
>> If I wanted to tell you that I had
3 pets and this value was hardcoded,

131
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,240
then I could just use a
simple print test statement.

132
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,320
But our value is actually
stored in a variable.

133
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,260
So how do you print the
values stored in variables?

134
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,880
>> For this we take
advantage of placeholders.

135
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,540
Say I had already declared
an initialized integer n.

136
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,170
Then later on if I wanted to print that
value, then I would write the string.

137
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,500
And instead of that value I would use
a placeholder for that integer-- %i.

138
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,800
Then after the string, I have a
comma, followed by the variable

139
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,950
that I want to print.

140
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,550
And later on, when it prints,
it'll print the value of n.

141
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,570
>> I could also use a placeholder
for a float, for instance.

142
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,000
If I wanted to tell you how
much cash I have in my pocket,

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,820
then I could say I have %f dollars.

144
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,330
And later on when it prints, then n will
take the place of that place holder.

145
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,530
I could also, for instance, use several
placeholders for several variables.

146
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,590
So as long as I list
them in order, then I

147
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,390
can tell you how many
dogs and cats I have.

148
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,710
>> Now we know how to prompt the
user for an amount of change,

149
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,130
ensure that that input
is valid, and then we

150
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,370
have two possible ways of implementing
the greedy algorithm of always using

151
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,090
the largest coin possible.

152
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,050
Because we've kept track of
how many coins we're using,

153
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,210
we can then print that value at the end,
telling the user how many coins they're

154
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,240
getting back.

155
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,240
>> My name is the Amayla, and this is CS50.

156
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,915
