1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,640
ZAMYLA CHAN: It's a-me, Zamyla.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,950
Today, we're going to implement
Mario, where we draw Mario

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,730
a full pyramid for him to jump over.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,430
Let's break down the
sub-tasks for this problem.

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,930
>> First, we want to prompt the user
for the height of the pyramid.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,510
And then we want to make sure
that that input is valid.

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,280
And then we're going to
want to draw the pyramid.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,850
>> So let's talk about prompting
and validating user input.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,920
It might look something like
this, a do-while loop that

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,250
prompts the user for an
integer and then only repeats

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,700
if that integer is invalid.

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,220
So what should this condition be?

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,630
>> For this, let's go back
to the specification.

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:46,240
Well, the spec tells us that any valid
height is going to be between 0 and 23,

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,350
inclusive.

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,400
So then that means that any invalid
height is going to be less than 0

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,840
or more than 23.

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,220
>> So now that we have this information,
let's design our condition.

20
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,230
But we need to be careful,
because now we have

21
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,130
two Booleans that we want to evaluate.

22
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,150
>> Here I've provided you
with a truth table.

23
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,520
This allows us to take two
Booleans, Boolean one and two.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,600
And we can evaluate either bool1
and bool2 or bool1 or bool2.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,390
>> So what's the difference
between and and or?

26
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,810
Well, bool1 and bool2 will
evaluate to true if and only

27
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,680
if both Booleans are true,
whereas the or operation

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,190
will be true if either one of
the Booleans or both are true.

29
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,110
So with this in mind,
see if you can figure out

30
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,460
what the appropriate condition for
your do-while loop for an invalid n

31
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,850
is going to be.

32
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,540
>> With that, we've prompted and validated
the user for the height of the pyramid

33
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,550
that they want.

34
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,740
So now, it's up to us
to draw the pyramid.

35
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,520
The full pyramid for this
problem will look a little bit

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,340
like this, where we have a left pyramid,
some gap, and then a right pyramid.

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,630
So let's break this down a little bit.

38
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,510
>> If I go to my text editor, here I've
drawn us a left-aligned pyramid.

39
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,160
But that won't do.

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,139
What we want to do is we want to
create a right-aligned pyramid first.

41
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,580
So to do this, to just push
my hashes along to the side,

42
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,240
I'm just going to put some characters
in between, just these dots.

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,560
Then I'm going to put two on the
next line, and one on that line.

44
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,070
And so here I have a
right-aligned pyramid.

45
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,540
>> After that, I'm going to
go back to the top row

46
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,930
and put in the gap, which
is, per the spec, two spaces.

47
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,680
Then I'm going to fill in the
other side of the pyramid.

48
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,030
I'm going to go to the second row, write
two spaces for the gap and then two

49
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,920
hashes.

50
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,020
Back to the third row, two spaces
for the gap and three hashes.

51
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,480
And at the end, two spaces
for the gap and four hashes.

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,400
So that's what a full
pyramid will look like.

53
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,260
>> Of course, we don't want
these dots in the way.

54
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,220
So we're going to replace these
dots by putting some spaces in.

55
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,720
One, two, three on the first line.

56
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,650
One, two on the second.

57
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,200
And one on the third line.

58
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,060
So this is what we would do if we
wanted to just make a full pyramid,

59
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,700
say, in our text editor.

60
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,860
>> So let's take this,
understanding the patterns,

61
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,870
and convert it over to some pseudocode.

62
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,500
For each row of the pyramid, we want
to print the left pyramid and then

63
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,580
the gap and then the right pyramid.

64
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,260
For the left pyramid, we print
the requisite amount of spaces,

65
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,740
followed by the hashes.

66
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,030
Then we print the gap, which
is just two spaces every time.

67
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,080
And in the right pyramid, we print
the requisite number of hashes.

68
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,410
>> For the second row, we conducted
the same exact process.

69
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,510
We print the spaces for the left
pyramid, the requisite amount

70
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:49,930
of hashes, the gap, two spaces, and
then the hashes for the right pyramid.

71
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,490
>> Let's tackle the pattern
for the left pyramid.

72
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,660
If I had, for purposes
of this example, a height

73
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,790
of eight requested by the
user, then my first row

74
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,020
would have one hash and seven spaces.

75
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,860
My second row would have
two hashes, six spaces.

76
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,749
Third row, three hashes, five spaces.

77
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:09,040
You can probably do this
yourself for a height of eight

78
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,470
and determine for each row how many
hashes and how many spaces you need.

79
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,209
But what we want to do is
we want to abstract it.

80
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:22,660
So I ask you for any nth row, how many
hashes and how many spaces do we need?

81
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,410
>> Now, as you determine the
pattern for how many hashes

82
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,920
and how many spaces you need for
any nth row for a given height,

83
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,910
remember to be careful
of how you're indexing.

84
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,160
What I mean by this is that in everyday
life most of us start counting by one.

85
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,680
So the first row would be number one.

86
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,620
And the second row would be row
number two, so on and so forth.

87
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,620
>> But in computer science and
CS50, we are zero-indexed.

88
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,750
So we actually start counting at zero.

89
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,020
So the first row would
be row number zero.

90
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,640
And the second row
would be row number one.

91
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,510
So if I had a height of eight for
my pyramid, then the last value of n

92
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,850
would actually be seven and not eight.

93
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,010
>> So be careful about this.

94
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,750
And be aware when you're determining
your pattern whether your zero-indexed

95
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,360
or one-indexed

96
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,070
>> OK.

97
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,380
So now that we have the
pattern for the left pyramid,

98
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,650
we need to determine
the pattern for the gap.

99
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,480
Luckily, this is really easy.

100
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,690
It's just always two spaces.

101
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,240
>> So now we proceed to the right pattern.

102
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,220
The first row will have one hash.

103
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,640
The second row, two.

104
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,530
Third row, three.

105
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,790
So on and so forth.

106
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,540
So again, determine for any abstract
n and any height how many hashes

107
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,810
and how many spaces
each row should have.

108
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,700
>> OK.

109
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:45,050
So we know that for each row we
need to conduct some process.

110
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,600
How do we do that?

111
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,440
Well, we use the for loop construct,
comprised of an initialization,

112
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,310
a condition, and an update.

113
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,830
For loops can be used
to repeat processes.

114
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,610
>> So say I want it to say hello,
world 50 times, then my for loop

115
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,510
would look something like this, where
I initialize my variable to zero.

116
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,200
The condition is that i is less than 50.

117
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,670
And then the update is that it
increments by one every time.

118
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:14,700
So what this would do would be to
print hello, world 50 times in a row.

119
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,080
>> Now, say I wanted to iterate
over the height of the pyramid.

120
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,560
Then instead of hard coding
some value in the condition,

121
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,280
I just use the variable height.

122
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,180
So what this will do is iterate
over the height each row.

123
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,280
And I can do something inside
of the body of that loop.

124
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,710
>> What do we want to do
inside the body of the loop?

125
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,550
Well, as we indicated before, we want
to print the spaces and the hashes

126
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,730
for the left pyramid and then print
two spaces and then print the hashes.

127
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,500
So we've already figured that out.

128
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,670
So we can start to fill
in our program a lot more.

129
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,850
>> Here I have an outer for loop that
iterates over every row in the pyramid.

130
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,340
And inside that body I'm going
to print spaces repeatedly,

131
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,860
hashes repeatedly, and then the gap,
and then hashes for the right pyramid,

132
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,440
and then, finally, a new
line to start the next row.

133
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,860
>> With that, we've prompted
the user for the input.

134
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,510
We've made sure that it's valid.

135
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,280
And then we've drawn the pyramid.

136
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,540
So Mario can successfully
climb the pyramid.

137
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,970
>> My name is Zamyla.

138
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,840
And this is CS50.

139
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,419
